Angular framework + firebase database.


Dependencies:
1. npm
2. node


npm install:
1. angular/cli
2. firebase angularfire2


Root is /create

No need to configure database environment. I just committed everything to simplify this process. When we make a final commit, we can add the keys to a text file and add that file to the gitignore.

I *think* that's all everyone needs to know for now
