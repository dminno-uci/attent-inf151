  "Professor Thornton is a phenomenal lecturer, and he is able to provide the perspective of a full-time software engineer as well. ICS 46 is by no means an easy course - the projects are time-consuming and the tests difficult. However, Thornton will give you every opportunity to succeed and grow as a programmer. Accessible, caring, entertaining.",
  "Thornton actually TEACHES. Always accessible. I attended class AND read & took notes from online lecture. This class asks for a lot but it is damn worth it. I feel much more confident in my ability to solve problems. Those projects can be crazy fun & hard. Midterm was 2x harder than the final. Aim to be above the average scores.",
  "Gives amazing lectures that make up for ICS 31, assigns projects that are fun to do, grades the harder projects generously, but talks a bit too much about his dog that he sometimes has to rush the end of lecture, which is the most important part. Also, idk if anyone else suffered from the automated tests he uses to grade the projects, but I did.",
  "Best professor at UCI I've had so far. His lectures always flew by since he knows how to teach. When doing coding examples, he always explains WHY he chooses to solve a problem the way he does. Exams were difficult but not impossible. Projects were hard, so make sure to go to another lab section if you feel your current TA isn't helping you.",
  "Thornton is not an easy professor nor the concepts he teaches. So be prepared to spend a lot of time on this class and make sure you START YOUR PROJECTS EARLY. For midterm and final, just make sure you read his notes. EVERYTHING on the midterm and final is mentioned in his notes at some point. Also Be prepared to study yourself. Good Luck!",
  "Thornton is the best teacher at UCI. Had him for 32, and 46 was also a great class. The midterm and final are hard, but curved like crazy. I was able to get an A. Not an easy class but very useful and important. Wouldn't want to take it with anybody else.",
  "The class is a big leap from ICS 31 so be prepared to work a lot harder. The projects are difficult but doable if you start early on them. The midterm and final are very hard and there are no practice exams. Thankfully there is a generous curve at the end. A third of the class received a C- or below, which means they have to retake the class.",
  "Engaging and interesting lectures. Projects can sometimes be tough, and require a lot of attention to detail to ensure correct implementation of data structures. Picky in the grading of them too - runs lots of hidden test cases against your programs to determine your score. Conceptual & detail-oriented exams that can be tricky.",
  "the projects in this class are totally harder than the previous class. I had an A+ on 31 but I think I will fail in this class, and I have to retake this awful class. He won't give any sample for exams.",
  "Thornton is solid! He's quirky and funny and really makes concepts clear. He has online notes that are basically his lectures which are really helpful. His projects are a bit challenging but teach you a lot. Get ready for lectures about his dog and a good time!",
  "This class wasn't actually that hard because he covered basic/simple topics in a concise/easy-to-understand way. But the midterm and final in his class were extremely difficult. To succeed, read his lecture notes carefully, work hard on the projects and try to do well on them. Professor Thornton curves so bad grades on tests won't screw you over.",
  "Really nice class would take again",
  "Prof. Thornton is an amazing instructor. I wish more CS classes were taught by him. It's not every quarter you come across such an inspirational professor. Get ready to program some 300-500+ lines of code per program.",
  "One of the best ICS lecturers at UCI. Also one of those rare lecturers where every lecture was almost full. Unlike most ICS professors, he didn't just teach some new programming concepts, but he also provided insight on how to go about programming something interesting.",
  "This man is the best of the CS Department of UCI. If I could I would take him all 4 years. God bless you Alex Thornton",
  "Savor this class before you take 33. Make the most your free time now b/c Pattis bouta make your free times only one line. To prep for final just read his notes on his website and make sure you understand it well by testing on python shell.",
  "His programming projects are challenging, but not too hard to solve. His midterm and final are not too hard, but you must be careful with those minor details of Python.",
  "TOOK ICS32A! Though lecture isn't mandatory GO, it helps you for the projects & Thornton tries to be interesting. One midterm & final, 5 projects. Got a 59% on the midterm & a high 60 on the final but only got one B on the 1st project & A's for the rest, so don't worry if you're not the best tester, just do well on the projects & you should pass!",
  "Thornton is a great lecturer! He kept it interesting and fun. The programming assignments were difficult, but I enjoyed them. I highly recommend going to all the lectures but labs are just free coding time, so you don't necessarily need to go. I only went to one lab the entire quarter. Overall, I enjoyed his class and I hope to have him again.",
  "amazing instructor in ICS department. challenging, but doable. You learn a lot of real-world programming technique. tests are tricky so make sure to understand his notes and understand why things work. Interesting lecture you wont feel bored. I wish he teaches some upper divs as well.",
  "This is the course you DO NOT want to make a single mistake. If you didn't pay attention, you pay for it with heavy price. And TA Yoshi, he just takes as much points as he can in the project unless you've done everything perfect.",
  "Alex Thornton teaches good programming and design through intuitive projects. Lectures are amazing, notes and instructions are concise and focused. Just show up to lecture, review the notes, and start the projects early. Go to office hours if you're struggling with design or concepts. He'll be happy to offer resources or re-explain.",
  "Projects aren't nearly as hard as people make them out to be. You might be forced to pull an all nighter at some point in the quarter but what else can you expect from an accelerated CS class. Thornton is reasonable and provides clear grading guidelines. Overall great class and great introduction to university level programming.",
  "Projects weren't as hard as people claim but the grading is atrocious. Uses automated tests to grade homework so one deviation from the write up can fail multiple tests and bomb your project score even when 99% works. Midterm and final make up half your grade and writing code on paper is not a good way to test programming knowledge. Useless Lab.",
  "He might be a good programmer, but for sure not a good teacher. He did not organize the class schedule well which left us had no enough time to finish the last two projects. The projects are extremely complicated and the two tests are extremely hard. Always publish his notes really late and not really useful for the tests.",
  "Great professor, very good at teaching concepts and explaining them, and also humorous. The pacing really in the accelerated 32A class is no issue for most. Projects are mostly easily, except for one that was extremely time consuming. Tests are on the difficult side, but overall, the class was enjoyable.",
  "I think the whole idea of 32A is bad because they try to teach you python during the first week, which is not only a lot of facts thrown at you at once but puts you behind schedule because, which is what happened this time. I disliked the class, projects were hard, notes weren't published on time, and he isn't very approachable for questions",
  "This class really depends on you. It is a very serious class and you should expect to have a lot of work. It might be hard for someone who has just started programming, and someone who is experiencing python for the first time. Thornton is a tough grader and projects are not easy; however, they force the students to come to the lectures.",
  "There can be bad teachers who teach easy classes, and good teachers who teach hard classes. This is an example of a great teacher who teaches a difficult class. He is vibrant, engaging, and is really responsive when you ask for help. You will have to work very hard in this class, but Thornton does everything to help you enjoy doing so.",
  "Honestly think that while the course is difficult by nature, Thornton tries hard to keep the lectures interesting and applicable. The final projects were a bit too difficult to finish given the time constraints, but the overall difficulty is manageable with lecture attendance.",
  "He gave the crazy long, hard project and wanted student to finish within few days. Assuming the students already knew everything and the lectures weren't related to project too much. You have to hand write code in the exam and the exams are crazy hard. The notes always came out late and almost never catch up with lectures.",
  "Expects you to know everything ahead of time and if you don't know a topic, makes you feel bad about it when you ask for help. Labs are very open ended and doesn't help in office hours. Lectures are 90% focused about his dog and last 20 minutes of class are used teach relevant topics that are covered on the midterm and final (which are really hard)",
  "Professor Thornton is easily one of the best CS professors at UCI. His lectures are clear and thorough and he has a good sense of humor. However, his lab assignments are pretty difficult and they do take a long time to figure out. In addition, his exams are ridiculously hard. Luckily he accounts for this with a big curve.",
  "Focus on so many little things. The projects are crazy long and complicated. Very difficult!",
  "Alex is one of the best professors I've ever had. His lectures are amazing! He is good at explaining things. He clearly knows where we need to get in this class. You can learn a lot from the projects he assigns. It's not hard to get a good grade as long as you really do your work. He's good at what he does and can make you love what you learn.",
  "Favorite professor thus far at UCI. I highly respect and recommend Thorton.",
  "Not only does he know his stuff he knows how to transfer that knowledge to his students. Great lecturer, solid examples in class. Exams are detail driven. Exams are not so much about your ability to program (that's tested with projects), more if you understand the minor details about the language.",
  "Incredible professor. You definitely need to work hard for this class though, but thorntons enthusiasm I think makes his students enjoy the work enough that they'd be willing to spend time and effort on it. Huge curve at the end too, the final was very hard, I got a D but still ended up with an A in the class. An 83% overall grade was still an A.",
  "Similar with grading and organization as ics32. Thornton does his best to make lectures interesting. If you miss lecture, notes are online. Projects are difficult but doable and you get a good amount of time to complete them. The midterm and final are super hard (averages were 50-60). But the curve was really good",
  "As in ICS 32, Thornton is an excellent professor for ICS 46. Lectures were clear and engaging on fundamental data structure concepts. The projects were interesting, mixing both implementation and real-world applications of data structures/algorithms. Exams can be somewhat difficult/tricky - very conceptual with little C++ coding. And curves well.",
  "Go Boo! Thornton's very informative live coding, along with detailed notes online, will ensure that you'll have all you need to do the projects. If you're coming in as a new programmer like many, you'll be in good hands. He teaches great coding practice, and the projects are just difficult enough to be good mediums to apply what he teaches you.",
  "A real genuine professor that understands the student's to a very great extent. His lectures were really helpful towards his programming assignments, and he makes sure to make each lecture as lively as possible. Missing lecture isn't that big of a deal, since he posts his notes online, but I find that it's best to read the notes no matter what.",
  "Like in ics 32, his lectures were conceptually great. Unfortunately, he sometimes took too long and had to rush some things during lecture, and wasn't as good as in 32 because of this. With this drawback, he's still really good. I would recommend him, but you need to make sure you stay up to date or else you will fall behind.",
  "An eccentric and warm-hearted person who makes his intentions clear with his teaching. Class is reasonably difficult, and guy gives good lectures without making you fall asleep.",
  "Thornton gives AMAZING lectures. He live-codes in lecture from scratch so you know exactly what he's doing. He also posts his lecture code online, along with very detailed information about the lecture material that day. His projects get progressively more difficult, so make sure you know your ICS31 concepts. Also, be prepared for his dog, Boo.",
  "I know a lot of people say this but it's true it is a HUGE step up from ICS31. The projects and midterm/final are a lot harder and really require you to know your stuff. He's a good professor, very engaging and clearly knows what he's talking about. There is a generous curve too.",
  "Thorton was easily one of the best professors I've ever had.",
  "Alex has fantastic and engaging lectures. Computer science has never been this interesting before.",
  "Thornton is very popular and extremely knowledgeable. His projects are doable. His exams are challenging and tricky. He does not pass back exams, so you cannot learn and study from them-- which is the only complaint I have about Thornton, because I, for one, learn a lot from my exams. Huge curve at the end of the course.",
  "Top notch professor. Speechless. You will look forward to going to lectures!",
  "Professor Thornton is a great lecturer and, at least from what I have been able to gather, always has well thought-out courses. Yes, the programming assignments are rather difficult and frustrating at times, but you do learn a lot. Beware of his tests. They are very difficult. But this class is curved and the curve is amazing.",
  "Thornton is a brilliant professor - his lectures are insightful, informative, and entertaining ; you won't be bored. The projects require a fair amount of work but are fun and definitely interesting. His exams are difficult, and contain conceptual and coding questions. However, he curves the class generously at the end. Boo and him are great!",
  "Thornton's lectures manage to be genuinely funny and interesting at the same time. He emphasizes his labs over his tests, because he knows just as much as we do that CS tests are kinda bullshot, and he mostly curves them out of the overall grade to make sure that the majority of the people will pass, or about 4/5 of the class in my case.",
  "Labs are doable and fun(it depends on you. For me, they were easy but my peers didn't really love them). Exams are tricky. A lot of readings and practice to get concept. Very good and enthusiastic lecturer.",
  "His lectures are important because concepts he mentions in class come up on the midterm and final. The midterm and final are tricky including matching sections as well as code and concepts. He curves pretty decently. The labs are fairly difficult so start early. Lectures were amazing, really great at getting you into the subjects.",
  "The best professor.",
  "Great professor",
  "Spends most of the lecture talking about his dog. 10/10 would take again",
  "Written tests may have a few tricky questions so make sure to study the notes. Keep procrastination to a minimum on programs, especially when it comes to anything Othello. He talks about his son/dog Boo a lot, but you'll get used to it.",
  "I kind of like him, but at the same time I kinda don't. He is definitely a passionate and helpful lecturer, but he can go on talking about irrelevant things sometimes. He also types really fast so it's a bit hard for me to keep up during lectures, however, he is still a good instructor. The labs are a huge jump from 31, and they are pretty hard.",
  "Thornton's lectures were very interesting and you don't have to take notes since he posts them online with comments. This class took a hood portion of my time but if you don't procrastinate on the labs then it's not bad at all. The labs were awesome and graded fairly! Read his notes very carefully. He asks questions about little details from notes.",
  "Pro. Thornton is definitely one of the interesting and responsible professors I've met. He can always give us inspiration especially at the beginning of our CS study. And the final grade turns out great even if u feel bad about final.",
  "HUGE jump from ICS 31. However, coming from someone with no experience other than that first class, I found ICS 32 to be manageable and rewarding. The projects are long, but interesting; make sure you don't put them off to the last minute! Thornton is a great and hilarious professor, I would definitely take another class with him (and Boo!).",
  "Energetic, hilarious, and clear. I enjoyed going to the lectures, despite their length, and this was due to Thornton. I found the class easy, but I've been a bit ahead of most classmates. Often talks a lot then codes a lot at very end, but otherwise very nice lectures. Focused on bigger picture. First 2 projects are partnered, next 3 aren't, (yay!)",
  "ICS 32 is that attention-wanting child that takes too much of your time and you start to neglect other children (classes) if you're not the strongest in coding yet. It's a big jump from 31, but Thornton is a very energetic and helpful guy. You're forced to take little parts of notes and apply it to projects. He's a decent professor, but very tough.",
  "Let's be real. ICS 32 is a giant jump from ICS31. This is going to be very hard compared to what you are used to. However, Alex does a great job at teaching this course and helps you get ready for real world applications in programming. Definitely attend every lecture and alway start your projects ahead a time! He's entertaining and clear.",
  "Best college professor I've had yet! Lectures are long, but he keeps you entertained with a big personality and funny jokes.",
  "Great professor! The projects are really cool and fun, and his lectures were the best.",
  "After taking Alex for ICS 32, I was excited to see him again for 45C. Nothing has changed, great lecturer, explains things clearly, and the lecture notes online are easy to follow. Projects were a bit strenuous because it's C++ and the tests were highly conceptual, making it pretty difficult. Nonetheless, Thornton is awesome! So is Boo.",
  "Thornton is one of my favorite lecturers. He starts his code from scratch and explains everything clearly. If you focus for the full 80 minutes, you'll learn a lot. Labs are difficult, but that's because C++ is so annoying to work with. Tests are even more difficult, but he curves grades at the end so you usually only need about a D to pass.",
  "If you like Thornton, you'll like 45C. Definitely one of the tougher classes I've taken, but a ton of fun to figure out. C++ just sucks in general. I highly recommend you take this class with him, I learned a lot.",
  "I learn a lot in lecture. Haven't needed to use the textbook once. He takes very thorough notes about every topic and uploads them to the website. Freely answers questions in lecture and bonus points for being funny. Overall 9/10.",
  "Great lectures. Missing one is equivalent to missing your favorite TV show, except you actually learn something. Out of all the ICS 30 series professors, his assignments are the most practicaldown-to-earth.",
  "Excellent Lecture, but is not an easy A. You must attend every lecture and listen to what Alex is talking about to make sure you can do perfect for every project. Midterm avg. is 19 out of 26. Almost half of student may be failed this class. However, Alex is a very excellent teacher.",
  "If you're going to take ICS 46, do yourself a favor and take it with Thornton. The concepts are not easy, but Thornton spends a lot more time TEACHING you than telling you to go read the 1000-page-long notes (cough Pattis cough). His notes are thorough, but aren't online, so attendance is mandatory. The tests are really hard, but fair (take notes!)",
  "I don't really understand why he's praised. His ics 32 was fine back then, but his ICS46 is pretty bad. I barely learn anything from him. He just goes over the basic concepts during the lecture and pretty much goes \"Oh here you go, survive well!\". His lecture is confusing and he goes around the bush, yet he doesn't provide any extra study material.",
  "I'm currently getting close to wrapping up my third class taken with Thornton. I'll admit, his class is certainly not an easy A and the tests are pretty difficult. However, all the credit that might bring your grade down on tests can reasonably be made up by doing well on projects. He teaches in a very life-applicable way, which I value greatly",
  "You learn a lot in this course. Make sure you understand EVERYTHING in the lectures and don't procrastinate on the labs. They will probably take you longer than you think. Make sure to go to lecture too so you know how to do the labs correctly, instead of your own way. Overall he seems like a nice guy.",
  "Best professor teaching me since the beginning of this school year. His lecture si truly interactive and interesting, partially because of his lovely Boo. Humble, humorous and helpful. Lab work spends up plenty of time, and yet sometimes the exams do go tricky. But nice to have it curved. Great pleasure to have him taught me ICS 32.",
  "He is a great lecturer. He is definitely really helpful and responsive, such as in email. Just spend time doing the projects and make sure they do everything you're asked, and you'll get full credit there. Study code examples in full detail for midterm and final, as that is what will help because they are hard. Curve saved my grade.",
  "Be sure to read the code examples and internalize them as soon as they come out, work on the lab little by little and you'll be fine. Do not wait until the last day, it never works, these assignments require your full attention. There is a generous curve, my D+ is a solid C. Also be sure to attend lecture, I missed a final question by ditching.",
  "A very enthusiastic lecturer. Explains the materials very clearly and keeps you engage in lecture. Have a clear grading criteria, tells you exactly what he expects from you. The midterm and final are fairly difficult, make sure you know your subject well enough. However, the curve is pretty generous at the end.",
  "Alex is an amazing CS professor, probably one of the best in the department. His lectures are very enthusiastic, but can sometimes be a bit repetitive. Projects are very interesting, but challenging. Midterms and final were tricky. Alex also works as a software engineer, which made me learn more about the real world, not just programming.",
  "He makes a fundamental programming class really funny and interesting. Quite an energetic personality that makes you look forward to go to class compared to other CS courses. You HAVE to understand and do all the labs in order to do well on his exams which that are tricky. Talks about how boo likes it doggy style all the time for some reason o_o",
  "Very enthusiastic and very fun to listen to! He's a very responsive professor and gives very uplifting speeches. Projects are very hard and require a lot of time. The midterm is very tricky as well. However, there is a generous curve.",
  "He's an excellent professor. He has an uncanny ability to keep you entertained, despite him being on topic. He goes off topic plenty, and they are some fun spiels to listen to. If you EVER need help, email him or go to his office hours. He's incredibly helpful and quick to answer. Don't be worried about the class. It's not hard if you work hard!",
  "Okay. Thornton's classes usually aren't that easy, and 45C is no exception. It can be tricky getting used to C++. His assignments are also challenging. However, it should be worth noting that he is one of the most helpful professors EVER. His office hours are the best, and his assistance will often save you. If you can take 46 with Thornton, do it.",
  "This is my second time having Thornton as a professor, and while many of the things I have said in the past remain true, one thing is for certain: his exams are very tricky. Regardless, he is a great lecturer and his projects are relatively interesting as always. It is no wonder that he is one of the most popular ICS professors at UCI.",
  "He's a cool professor and he really wants you to succeed. He has a \'one-time, no questions asked, no notification needed two-day late policy\" that is really helpful for that time when nothing is going right.",
  "He's a good professor. He actually codes in class to show you how things work and it's really helpful. His labs are pretty easy but if you need help don't be afraid to ask for it. He's a nice guy and funny. He talks about his dog a lot but I didn't mind that. I wish he was teaching ICS 33 instead of Pattis.",
  "Thornton's lectures are hilarious and interactive. He's a real chill, go-with-the-flow type of guy but you definitely learn a lot in this course. Yes, you might have a mild heart attack when you see your first midterm score but the final curve of the class is awesome.",
  "My third course with Professor Thornton (ICS 32, ICS 45C, and ICS 46) and Thornton has continued to the be amazing lecturer he is. Extremely charismatic. Very clear and animated during his lecturing. Extremely professional and prompt at replying to emails. Exams are challenging and ICS 46 is very different from other Thornton courses. Study hard!",
  "This is my 3rd class with Thornton and like always Thornton has been the same charismatic and very intelligent lecturer he is. 46 is a lot different then 45C and 32 keep that in mind. Very concept based. The labs are really hard and the midterm/final were very hard. Study hard and you will pass. Thornton is the best at responding to your emails!",
  "Great professor! Very passionate and humorous. This class was challenging and time-consuming, but it really brought up my interest in CS.",
  "Alex was an amazing professor. I never was bored in his class, his projects were challenging but manageable, and best of all he is a super funny and nice guy. Take the class, you won't regret it!",
  "Possibly the best teacher I've had so far in UCI. I've had him for three classes thus far, and he has been crystal clear throughout in his teaching. Passionate and brilliant.",
  "Professor Thornton tries his best to make a 1.5-hour programming lecture as interesting as possible... but with mixed success. However, he is a very resourceful instructor and will respond to any questions you throw at him in a timely manner. The class itself is not too difficult so long as you understand all the information.",
  "If you read the instructions you can basically ace the projects. He basically spoon feeds you the project core codes during his lectures. Final and midterm are easy if you know how to do your projects.",
  "He's funny, intelligent, and a great lecturer. This class is a HUGE jump from ICS 31 and the projects do require a lot of time. Midterm and final are difficult, so you really need to know your stuff. The curve is generous, but it will not save you if you slack off. Many people end up failing because they underestimate this class' difficulty.",
  "He's an excellent lecture, but this class is a HUGE jump from ICS 31 and the projects DO require a lot of time. Midterm and final are difficult, so you really need to know what you're doing. Many people underestimate the difficulty of this class and end up failing - do not be one of them. Curve is generous, but will not save you if you slack off.",
  "Professor Thornton is quite great. The course, in my opinion, is about exposure to Python's library, and finding the right tools to solve the problem. Professor Thornton does this with interesting projects, and entertaining class meetings. I highly recommend him, just make sure you don't wait till the last minute to do the work.",
  "Good teacher overall. Believe what everyone else tells you in that this class is a leap from 31 in terms of difficulty. You need to know even the briefly talked about concepts like the back of your hand. The labs are also fairly challenging but doable and rewarding. Thankfully he curves the class at the end very generously. You'll learn a lot.",
  "Great sense of humor and fun lectures. However, his exams are no joke-- make sure you REALLY understand the concepts. Code examples on his website are useful, but I'd advise you to attend lectures to know what he emphasizes for tests. Also, beware: even if you breezed through ICS 31, you may struggle here. It's a steep climb in difficulty.",
  "Alex is a funny teacher. He definitely knows how to make fun out of himself and make his lecture vivid and interesting. However, it's really hard for you if you are not that interested in computer science. Labs will kill you if you procrastinate. Midterm will be much harder than your 31 final. If you love cs, take it, or just find another direction",
  "He does not update his website and notes on time. Besides that, he is an interesting teacher.",
  "The class was really challenging, but in a good way. Things we learned in that class appeared really applicable. I would love to have Thornton again for future classes. Since Thornton is a part-time software programmer, he's one of the most knowledgeable professors I have had. The labs were interesting, tests difficult. Definitely study.",
  "/sobbing because I got a C and have to retake/ BUT he was a good professor. He taught things very well and surprisingly I don't mind being in this class again. It'll help me get a better grasp of the concept. The class is fairly difficult, but you will definitely learn something. He also loves his dog, Boo.",
  "Clear speaker, interested and fun professor. Knows a lot about computing and creates an enjoyable and helpful learning environment. He sponsors independent work, meaning labs were a bit challenging and fun to complete, but requires a lot of effort from the student. There is a huge gap between ICS 31 and 32, so be prepared!",
  "His class is definitely challenging. Do NOT procrastinate on the labs, or they will end up killing you. This class definitely consumes most of your time. The midterm and the final were no joke. You need to know your stuff.",
  "Very good professor. He is a passionate lecturer with lots of funny jokes. He focuses more on practical teaching rather than theory. He's a professional software developer in the real world so he applies that to his teaching. His labs are very hard but very fun. You will learn so much.",
  "Prof. Thornton is DEFINITELY a pretty difficult CS professor. His projects are no joke and require a lot of outside research, refined logic, and TIME. Don't start his projects late, because it's so easy to underestimate just how much time a project will take. His lectures are very informative, and he's smart and knows the CURRENT computing world.",
  "He is an amazing professor and is really passionate about the subject. So long as you pay attention and put in the work on labs he assigns, he is easily one of the best computer science professors at UCI.",
  "The best professor I've had in CS so far. This guy just outdone my number 1 teacher in terms of quality. Very approachable and explains the material very very clearly. His tests were challenging since they require critical thinking to solve the question. I look forward to my next encounter with this professor.",
  "Thornton is an interesting professor. He's kind of odd but he's humorous and really great at explaining things. He sometimes goes off topic a bit but he still does a fairly good job at teaching and explaining the topics. His tests aren't that difficult if you pay attention to his lectures.",
  "He is a very entertaining professor. Sometimes he goes off on tangents but they are usually quite funny. He explains things well.",
  "Projects were very difficult but he is an extremely fair grader! I got a 69.9% but he gave me a B-. Lectures were ok, mildly interesting",
  "Thornton teaches concepts clearly but the details are sometimes lost. Excellent teacher overall, tests are hard, labs are fair and interesting (quite challenging actually). Got a C in the class but tried really hard and learned a lot...definitely worth the experience.",
  "Alex is easily the best teacher at UCI. If you want to understand the material in a way that makes it interesting, keeps you engaged, and sometimes even makes you laugh, take one of his classes. His understanding of the material is flawless and is only surpassed by his ability to explain it.",
  "Had him for both ics22 and cs141. Extremely smart & helpful; he makes it clear that he loves to educate. Probably the best professor I've had at UCI. If I've ever met anyone who deserves an honorary PhD, it's Alex Thornton. He is smarter than many of ICS' tenured professors (sad). Tests can be difficult, but DEFINITELY worth it.",
  "If Kevin Smith taught ICS, he would be Alex Thornton.",
  "Had him at COSMOS, he was fun.",
  "Best ICS professor ever! Extremely helpful. The assignments are challenging but you learn a lot in any of his courses if you put forth the effort. He's very enthusiastic about the material.",
  "By far, one of the best ICS professors at UCI! Super approachable, thorough, and clear. I wouldn't characterize his classes as easy, but you sure get a lot out of them. He really wants to make sure the students understand the material. He's got a great sense of humor and remembers what it's like to be a student. Take his classes whenever you can!",
  "Great teacher. Knowledgable. Extremely available and willing to help.",
  "Best professor in ICS, period! Easy to understand lectures, very helpfull! Always answers questions, full of energy during all classes.",
  "For freshman just starting in computer science I,m going to tell you to take all your intro classes with Thornton if you can. He tries to keep things interesting and will help you if he can. The only thing is if you ask him about something you should know already he can be quite condescending.",

  "Easily the best professor I've had at UCI so far. His lectures can sometimes be boring (cause of material) but he does a good job keeping the students interested. Very enthusiastic about the material and wants his students to learn the material. He is very helpful during office hours, class, email, and through newsgroups. Highly recommended.",
  "Very understandable and clear. A+++",
  "He's a very clear but fast lecturer. He doesn't use power point presentaion or slides in the class. So if you are not a native English speaker, you'll probably have a hard time keeping up with his fast paste trying to understand and maybe take notes in class. His exams are very hard. However, he's really patient and out there to help.",
  "thornton rocks. he's obviously into teaching; makes the class fun; and he is very approachable in office hours, if you are having trouble he will work with you. likely the best teacher ics has. (so far anyway)",
  "I must say that this is the best professor I've ever had at UCI. He's very enthusiastic and funny in class. The best part is that he's responsive. He responds to all his e-mails promptly and he's very helpful during office hours. Sure the work may not be easy, but you'll get a lot out of it.",
  "Great prof! He's very helpful and knows his stuff. Funny guy too!",
  "Great teacher. He is very helpful & tries very hard to make the class understand things. He drinks too much iced tea. The java portion of the class was very easy, the scheme portion was mildly challenging.",
  "Thorton is the best!!! his lectures are funny/you learn a lot.. he knows his stuff.. and i lik eth eway he presents everything... his labs on the other hand are wow.. very veyr hard... then again i always started the day it was due.. and spent like 8 hours on it.. just START EARLY on labs..",
  "22 is easy, 141 is a bit more difficult but Thornton will make you laugh and explains the overall concepts very well. Makes ICS fun! Labs in 22 are a joke (less than an hour a piece) but labs in 141 are loooong but not too hard.",
  "He's really knowledgeable and nice. His projects are really challenging, but he tries to be funny in lecture, which wastes a lot of time he could be using to make the material he covers more relevant to what is on the exams",
  "This guy has to be my favorite ICS prof so far. He seems to be one of the few who cares! Unlike some ICS profs, he does NOT have tenure and yet I've hated every prof that does. Coincedence&#63; Absolutely not. Plus, he does have a good joke every once and a while",
  "Great instructor - classes require a lot of hard work - but he is always willing to help. If you want easy classes, you shouldn't be in ICS anyway. He'll work you. Labs are tough, but you'll be all the better for it. You WILL know Java inside and out when he's done , but it will make life easier.",
  "To me, Prof Thornton's only pro is that he's not Jacobson. His con is that due to the organization of units stipulated by the ICS dept, the 2X series of classes have an ungodly amount of labs and exams. Tests were terrible.",
  "Took ICS 141, ICS 142. both very challenging courses with the very best instruction. Assignments and exams are difficult but fairly graded. Alex is very approachable and is always willing to spend time on clarification. Never a dull moment.",
  "Knows what he's talking about, but has a tendency to ramble. Very vague when answering questions, not very helpful. Unfortunately, he's the only ics22 teacher around..the labs are a pain in the ass.",
  "Probably the best professor I've ever had. The first thing I do when looking for courses is check if he's teaching anything I need to take.",
  "One of the best ICS lecturers.",
  "one of the best teachers i have had in my four years, hands down, all departments included. flawless rhetoric, entertaining, and always clear with his explanations. this is for any of the following: ICS 21, 22, 23, 141, 142, and 80",
  "good teacher, but labs and exams are surprisingly difficult. is very helpful if you go to his office hours",
  "Good, cool professor who really wants to help student to learn. At first he is not that great, but he is getting better now. Just do your lab all the time, then you should be alright.",
  "No Comments",
  "Best teacher @ UCI!! #1",
  "His multiple choice tests are hard... His labs are also long. But the labs are managable if you get his help. He is very willing to help any student.",
  "Awesome lecturer.. one of the best lecturers I've had in across any of my classes.",
  "Great teacher, like others have said, project are a bit tough, but very douable and he helps a lot on the newsgroup. Keeps your interested and is easy to follow in class.",
  "Cool guy, lively. One of the classes I never missed and stayed awake in. Take your notes and you won't need the book. Projects are challenging but usually interesting. Tests are pretty hard. Learn your O-notation!! haha",
  "my biggest supporter and most trusted advisor",
  "Good teacher, does a good job of explaining things so you can understand them, and continuously keeps you interested by telling stories. Had him for 22 and 23 , and would say overall a good professor, programs can be hard, but are doable.",
  "Had him for one of his first quarters at UCI. He was great. Very lively lecturer. One of my favorites.",
  "Thorty boy!",
  "good teacher, pretty interesting. The projects can be time consuming and the tests can be somewhat difficult, but overall not to bad.",
  "Pretty interesting teacher. Always saying this like since you pay a lot of money to study here.. and since I care about your education.. blah blah blah. Explains concepts clearly. Honestly,ics majors ya don't have much choice when you take 21-23",
  "Younger than the other professors and makes witty remarks.",
  "No Comments",
  "he teaches the class clearly and if u go to lecture then dont need the book",
  "He doesn't like the Clippers! If you love the Clippers, do not take the course...he is a Clipper hater. Otherwise he does a pretty good job teaching and keeps you interested by going off topic all the time. Tests are easy, projects are hard, good teacher!",
  "if you tend to fall asleep in class dont take thornton. you have to listen to his lectures and write everything down cuz his notes are like chicken scratch and he doesn't write half the stuf fhe says down.",
  "THEE best ics teacher on campus! He makes lecutures interesting too.",
  "Elective class, with long hard labs. Funny Guy though.",
  "Very funny! The one and a half hour with him is never boring. Always does his best to help students. Projects are hard, but fair.",
  "No Comments",
  "He ain't that great. Well, maybe the best around...but not THAAAT great.",
  "No Comments",
  "I'll never forget this class, hehe.",
  "the one before this was my messup, he definitely gets better scores",
  "Great ICS lecturer",
  "Easy teacher, but has no clue what he is teaching.",
  "Professor Frost holds pretty boring and mediocre lectures, but his lectures help out if you pay attention. However, he is very picky with answers to homework assignments and exams. His exams consist of material from lecture and the book. But all in all, you should not be too stressed for this class.",
  "Frost is a really great lecturer. Just listening to him talk you can tell that he really enjoys teaching the class and talking about Informatics. He does a good job of explaining the material. The class itself isn't great, I found the material pretty boring and it can be vague with difficult tests, but Frost himself is very good.",
  "This is a fun class. A little time consuming, but fun. Lectures are extremely optional because this class is essentially the video game version of ICS 45C. It's pretty easy. And some of the projects and programs are pretty fun to mess around with. Tests are easy too. Easy \"A\" as long as you're willing to put a little time into the projects.",
  "Professor Frost was interesting and funny, but his grading was tricky. You better read for the exams.",
  "Overall, Frost is a nice guy, is fairly interesting when it comes to lectures, and most certainly has a distinct sense of humor. The subject matter, on the other hand, can feel boring and sloggish. The class itself is quite easy, only consisting of 3 exams and 3 homework assignments, and he records all of his lectures and posts them online.",
  "Professor Frost is a great teacher. He explains what he wants very thoroughly and what will be on the test are questions that will not catch you off guard because he literally gives answers in his lectures if you pay attention and attend. Just do what he wants, which is very little, and you'll receive an A. I love him so much I had him for a year.",
  "Horrible Professor Irrelevant lectures pointless test questions and lots of reading. Not a helpful person and enjoys giving students bad grades. Convinced he is best person to walk the face of the earth",
  "Worst professor I've ever had. He makes you read long articles that are barley related to the topic of the class and spends most of the time talking about something that isn't the main point of the article. When grading either a test or an essay he looks for key words he expects. If you use a synonym to the word he wanted no credit.",
  "The entire CGS major here at UCI is a big joke, especially since it's run by Frost who doesn't even have a good understanding of modern games honestly. You're stuck reading about articles from the 1980s and what makes video games \"art\". Why not just list this course under the Arts huh? At least you're combining two equally poor curriculum",
  "Vague course with unclear instructions and expectations. Weekly quizzes were ridiculously nitpicky, often requiring exact wording. What he wanted from the assignments was also hard to understand because he was always so vague, especially the third one. Discussions were useless, and final contained a lot of random vocab we never covered in class.",
  "Generally easy course with very little of workload. Mandatory attendance for discussion sections for grade. Weekly quizzes, if you do the assigned readings you will pass them. Midterm and final were mostly all based on readings with some pulled from lecture. Three assignments that were somewhat vague. Very helpful in office hours.",
  "3 assignments, 12% each. 1st assignment was unorganized, 3rd assignment was vague. Expects you to memorize little details word for word from the reading assignments. Everything covered was too general. I feel like I learned nothing in this class. Hopefully next time he will use a textbook.",
  "Material covered is useful. Quiz and midterm were ridiculously hard. Memorize everything in the readings. Including small diagrams. Studied over 10 hours on midterm. Review questions are nothing like the midterm at all. Emphasis on minute details. Stupid class with stupid expectations. I hate classes with tests like these.",
  "Go to Lecture! His assignments are very broad and unclear. Other than that, his midterm and final are open notes (though it didn't help much).",
  "Go to lecture..No book used",
  "Sets the standard for Game Professors",
  "Reasonable grader, tough assignments. Somewhat challenging exams but not impossible. Interesting class but lost interest after a while in lecture since this past quarter it was a 3-hour lecture. Overall good class!",
  "Very reasonable grader, reasonable workload, and a fairly decent lecturer. His material may not always seem relevant, but it is important; attend all lectures, read all assigned readings, and do all of your assignments and you will pass this class easily. Extremely helpful, as well, and the structure of the class encourages creativity.",
  "Not hard to get a passing grade at all. However, the grading method is mainly based on opinion. This applies to the ICS 52 course as well. In other words you're not really learning anything. There is 1 benefit I got from CS 113 though, and that is networking with people.",
  "Frost has a knack for making lectures lively, even if the material is boring as hell. His tests, projects, and homework tend to focus on practical applications of the material, rather than memorization of the theoretical definitions. I wish he made the class harder, because the median class scores were always in the high 80s.",
  "He's a pretty interesting lecturer. Games as Art, Culture, and Technology is an easy class, so long as you come to lecture and discussion and everything. Note: it is particularly easy to not come to lectures for this class since they sometimes don't seem relevant.",
  "Fun class!",
  "This was a project course, so lectures were generally meaningless. A few were mandatory for presentations. This course was sweet though. Teams of four. A lot of freedom in creating a game. I learned a lot, mostly through independent research, and it models a real job better than most classes. A lot of work, but fun and interesting!",
  "This professor provided a great first look for our class on the entire software process model. Did a good job of introducing several software models as well as allowing us to apply what we learned using a system we had to document, implement and then test. The professor is very honest and easy going guy who keep class feeling relaxed.",
  "Just one of those classes that lacked direction. The projects were fairly interesting, but you have to remember the reading pretty well for quizzes and tests. Professor Frost seems to know the material well, but it was hard to grasp what the class was about.",
  "Frost is a really great professor who brings a lot of real-world experience to the classroom. Lectures are interesting and relevant to working in industry. Some labs are more relevant/interesting than others, but I feel that I got a pretty well-rounded sense of the various tools out there. Go to lecture and this class is an easy A.",
  "He is pompous and thinks pretty low of the students. He makes that clear when he grades your papers. No constructive criticism. He criticizes your paper for the sake of criticism. Not a great teacher as some would lead you to believe.",
  "No Comments",
  "He taught this class for the first time and it was horrible. POINTLESS lectures and irrelevent midterm and final = horrible class. He might be better when he teaches 52 or another class, but in this one it was horrible.",
  "No Comments",
  "I graduated but i can say that he was one of the top professors if not the top professor in ICS. He actually cares and will give you as much time as you need to help you learn not just get a given grade.",
  "Treats students with fairness and respect. Takes teaching seriously.",
  "Great Lecturer, his assignments weren't too hard though they took a while to do. Tests were also very fair and drew more from lecturer than the book. He has work experience, and taught this class like 10 times...so its very well grounded. He isn't too great at 1-1 live communication though.",
  "he has an easygoing likeable teaching style but this does not necessarily extend to one on one contact. like the other poster said he doesn't seem particularly interested in students' particular situations. all in all though he seem ok.",
  "lectures are useless. The projects and hws are challenging but haven't been changed from the previous quarters. He's not really nice or easy going on difficult situations of students.",
  "He is an interesting professor and teaches his courses really well. He has very easy-natured and is witty. Lectures are definitely worth going to (I'm usually the type that skips lectures, so thats saying a lot). Assignments and tests are somewhat challenging but is very helpful with reviews, emails, etc.",
  "Honestly, his sense of humor matches mine. It's wierd, but he cracks me up. His assignments were tough and time consuming, but I understand that that is the nature of the course. I took the same class w/ another professor and it was much less pleasurable. I recommend him over many other professors, by a long shot. Take him if you can.",
  "He is a nice guy and all, but his lectures are not very helpful. The projects are awesome, but the weekly homeworks get to be a bit much.",
  "Best ICS class I've had yet. Weekly hw assignments keep you on your toes and projects are pretty exciting. Top 8th of the class gets an A, which makes you work harder for the grade. He's pretty witty too.",
  "Frost is nice and is very clear in his lectures. I over-studied for the exam, as they were exactly as easier as the pratice ones. Be very careful with the style that they want the answers in! Otherwise he's a good prof who will teach you &quot;hands-on&quot; AI with projects.",
  "Very interesting professor. Worth taking 8am class for.",
  "pretty good teacher. Tests aren't too hard and explains stuff well.",
  "It is a decent class to work with. Most of the grade come from labs, so make sure it works. He is clear and precise about what he wants, so do ask him if you have questions. Enjoyable to talk with in front of class or in person.",
  "Very good teacher. Interested in teaching and helping students learn. Clear. Concise. To the point.",
  "Easygoing professor.",
  "Actually had him for 4 or 5 classes, great professor. Interesting projects, fun lecturer, not too tough.",
  "First time teaching h23...but he is an awesome teacher...projects are the most interesting i have had...he teaches interesting topics along with course material...midterms are relatively simple so long as you do your work...",
  "Made AI very interesting. Too many homeworks, but I learned a lot from them.",
  "Great teacher",
  "Willing to comprimise to make sure that you understand everything. Great teacher",
  "Just an overall great guy and teacher.",
  "The sexiest professor ever!!!!!!!!!",
  "It's so hard staying awake in class",
  "Very clear lectures, very nice guy.",
  "No Comments",
  "Not as good as Thornton", "Professor Mark is a pretty good professor. Pretty clear with stuff, the quizzes and exams are from the slides so you're chillin. She talks about her summers at Microsoft ALOT and it gets kinda boring so prepare for that lol.",
  "avoid this teacher/class if you can take something else. the workload is A LOT given that you have to submit a summary (more like an analysis..) each class period. the grading is tough on those articles too. 16 page readings and you have a single spaced page to cover all the points along with your own outside source for analysis. it's ridiculous.",
  "Article summaries 20% Write-up on past/future perspectives 10% Midterm exam 25% Final exam 35% Class participation/attendance 10% 1 page (SINGLE SPACED) summaries of 12+ page long readings due EVERY class, even midterm week. 3-4 page (single spaced again) essay. Calls randomly on people to present EVERY class on the readings/summaries.",
  "Tests are based on: 80% what she says during lectures, 20% readings. Lots of assigned readings. Very bad lecturer, barely knows how to use a computer but teaches about the Internet & tech, ironically enough. 2 tests, weekly HW requiring a short 2-page paper + 1 project at the end + Pop quizzes. Boring class, bad at teaching, takes effort for an A.",
  "i bombed the midterm and aced my final and did alright on the pop quizzes and got a b+ as long as you read, you pass. she takes attendence towards the end of class and those are part of your grade so just stay until then and leave afterwards. her slides are online and are the exact same thing as the readings assigned.",
  "She gives pop quizzes weekly that are based on the readings she assigns each week. She pretty much repeats what's on the PowerPoint during lecture which she posts online. Her tests are based on lecture and the assigned reading so be sure you know your material. If you need help, you can always ask her and she'll be happy to assist you.",
  "A lot of work, but great professor.",
  "I had her for ICS 3 and I thought she was a good professor. Her lectures can sometimes get a little boring, but she's really nice and easy to understand. Her tests are based mostly on the readings she assigned so the class is pretty easy if you just read the materials.",
  "Great teacher! Very interesting person to talk to. I really enjoyed the class.",
  "Pretty easy class. Read and study powerpoints before tests. I vouch for the previous review saying she is technologically challenged. Did not know hot keys for copy and paste. Blamed the lack of knowledge on being more used to MacOS (which also has the hotkeys).",
  "Mark talks alot about nothing, and has a superiority complex. She doesn't know as much as she thinks, and for a computer science teacher, she sure doesn't have a good handle on computer usage. If you cant even work the projector or youtube without help, you dont have any business being a computer science professor.",
  "Great teacher and speaks clearly. Presented interesting information and the projects and tests werent all that bad. Not the best class I ever took, but I did really enjoy it.",
  "She taught one of the best ICS classes I've ever taken. I very much was interested in the content of the class.",
  "She will let you get a hand on real life IT experience. She has a vast knowledge of the industry that she is working in. Her tests are not hard. The only hard part about this class is you finding a suitable teammate for the project. Other than that, its a very interesting class",
  "She's strict and tough, but a great professor. If you attend most lectures and participate in class, she'll like you. 132 requires a lot of reading and 1 big paper, but it's not hard. 135, bi-weekly assignments due, just like any other project course",
  "Tests are not clear and she expects very precise answers... they are a major part of the class... there is also ALOT of work in this class... daily writing assignments, each ranging from 3-10 pages or more.",
  "overall not bad. gives a lil too much work at times, and is very picky when grading tests. but work isn't too hard.",
  "Prof Kay is very kind and straight forward. His lecture are a bit boring but he always has time for questions. He's patient with everyone and the class is quite easy. There is pair programming for every project so be ready for switching partners every week. Easy A if you can do the basics of coding.",
  "Professor Kay does a really good job of introducing Python, especially since I had no prior background to coding. The assignments were fairly easy, but they do get more challenging towards the end. He does release previous midterms, so use those to study as well as the weekly quizzes. Overall, this class is very manageable.",
  "Professor Kay is awesome. ICS 31 is an intro course thus it is not a hard one. Be sure to ask questions when you don't understand any lab assignments and remember to REALLY do the quizzes. Study the past midterms and you'll be fine.",
  "Professor Kay is awesome.",
  "That was an easy class",
  "Easy A, amazing professor",
  "His teaching was very easy to understand, and the midterms aren't difficult if you study the previous midterms he posts. The labs were difficult towards the end of the quarter, but nothing compared to what you'll see after ICS 31. However, he's a great professor.",
  "Overall explains concepts well enough. Midterms are very easy because they are almost exactly the same as the previous midterms, which he posts with answers. Quizzes are also easy because they come with an answer key, though you should do it without the key if you actually want to learn. Lab is a bit harder, but not impossible. Would take again.",
  "The class is pretty boring, but is easy as long as you do the work. Most of the time, the lectures and programming assignments don't correlate, but that doesn't really make the class any less easy.",
  "For an intro CS class, ICS 31 was jokingly easy. Slow pace, extremely easy exams, but forced to do pair-programming for the programs.",
  "Easy teacher. Calm and somewhat indifferent. For ICS 31, you have to *try* to fail the course.",
  "Class is ridiculously easy. Exams are way too easy, and labs can be completed very quickly, though you are required to do pair-programming.",
  "David Kay is a perfect instructor for those going into their first programming class ever. He structures his midterms and tests in a comprehensive manner, and they're heavily based on the material covered in class, in labs, and sometimes in the readings. The labs themselves are VERY straightforward, almost designed cook-book style.",
  "Really nice professor. Very patient in answering questions. Although he usually do typings, that is totally fine for intro-programming.",
  "Very easy class. Good professor.",
  "He is really an amazing professor. His lecture is really clear and he is really helpful. Grades only depend on quiz per week with credit if you did it, pair-programming projects, one midterm and one final.",
  "Easy A. Lectures available online so attendance isn't mandatory. Clear explanations of basic programming concepts so you can have no prior programming experience and still get an A. Labs are easy and can be finished within 2-4 hours per week.",
  "Material taught in class is organized but not always related to lab. Labs are the most difficult part. Pair programming can be disappointing if you are paired up with people who aren't prepared. Midterms are very easy (just take the previous exams). There are online quizzes and partner evaluations that contribute to grade too. Final wasn't too bad.",
  "Lectures are helpful, but they hardly line up with what we have to do in lab. The lab stuff is more difficult. It's also pair-programming so you have to work with a new partner each week and depending on your partner, this could be a good or a bad thing. Tests are easy and based off practice exams posted online.",
  "Helpful lecture, great professor, easy A. To be honest, you will get A only with class notes.",
  "Do yourself a favor and read the textbook in the beginning if you are a beginner to programming in Python. He uploads recordings of his lectures online, but sometimes some will run into errors. I was in his 8am class so I relied heavily on them. Study them for tests. The last program (bed and breakfast) was long, so start early if you can.",
  "Lectures felt long and boring (quiet lecture hall while he was typing out the notes). Lab assignments were fine, but they got harder later in the quarter. The two midterms were very easy (just study past midterms), and the final was easy as well (let's you bring a page of notes).",
  "I honestly learned more in labs than in lectures. His notes are sometimes really confusing. The TA taught more than he did, so go to labs, they're essential for passing. Two midterms and final are all doable. I'm new to programming, but I still got an A.",
  "Kay is a good lecturer. He will teach you the the Computer Science fundamentals. Overall an intelligent and good lecturer.",
  "Took ICS31 w/ Kay Fall 2015. Lab attendance required, forced to do menial programming problems with a partner. Only went to first 2 lectures, skipped the rest. Terrible at lecturing, changes his tone/volume spastically, poor at explaining things. Actual lab work is easy beyond belief. Tests are relatively easy (30 min) TL;DR bad teacher, easy A",
  "DON'T EVER SKIP LECTURES OR LAB CLASSES AT. ALL.",
  "pretty good lectures. Explains things really well. exams are fair. Can give you more advice besides studies.",
  "Go to lecture, learn stuff, do labs, get A in class. Tests are very easy as long as you aren't slacking. I didn't read any of the book, missed online points, and got a solid A in the class because I understood the labs well. Lectures are boring, but VERY informative, so don't miss them. Bad lab partners are common (sucks), which helps you learn.",
  "Professor Kay teaches ICS 31, and he is experienced. Labs take up a huge part of your week, so beware of that (destined to non-comp sci majors)! His attendance isn't too great, and a lot of people are missing on concepts. The two midterms and final mainly test your attention to detail, so be careful with that. However, they are relatively easy.",
  "Professor Kay is a really helpful and clear lecturer. He truly wants you to succeed so go to lectures. However, if you can't, it's okay because he sends you emails of the lecture notes and replays. The labs are pretty doable, but get progressively harder and you might have to spend a lot of time on them. Overall, a pretty easy class.",
  "Enjoyable class! It is extremely easy to get an A on both midterms if you look over the past midterms. The final was easy too. If you genuinely try to complete the labs with your partner exactly how Professor Kay wants you to, you'll learn a lot of things that will make you think differently and outside of the box.",
  "Having Professor Kay for ICS 31 was pretty great. The class was really easy, especially if you have previous experience in coding. If you do have previous experience, the class is essentially a courter long review, and if not you will catch on quick with his lectures. You will have a lab every week with a partner, that covers the topic for the wk.",
  "Amazing Programming teach 11/10 IGN. He's papi AF",
  "He was a great professor who allowed an equal opportunity for each student to pass.",
  "Great teacher! Helped each everyone into the python language!",
  "The labs and lecture are really long. But he posts recordings online which is nice. A bad partner in lab can really put a downer on your week. Pair programming required though. Assignments are clear, but he doesn't give you a grade breakdown. Gives you a page of notes for the final.",
  "ICS 31 is an easy course for computer science. If you follow his steps during lectures, and do his lab assignments carefully and thoroughly, you will get a great score for this class.",
  "Tests are pretty easy. Get ready to spend about 10 hours per week on labs. Kay gives away lab questions in lecture. The book is a must for all newbies. Few people actually show up to lecture. All labs are done with a partner. Kay is clear with material and grading. Highly recommend.",
  "Perfect course! I have calculated that over 40% classmates got at least A- in fall 2014. Nearly the best choice for GE II! Labs are easy to finish even without your partner. DO NOT forget to do your quizzes! Good luck for getting an A!!!",
  "This is the easiest course I have taken at UCI so far. Not only because of the fact that the labs are pathetically easy, but also because of how Kay teaches. He does a very good job of easing you into the Python language. This is also great prep for future ICS courses. It might be a little more difficult if programming isn't your thing.",
  "An easy introduction course to Python; however, ICS 32 is a big jump. Lectures aren't necessary, as what Kay talks about is in the textbook. Labs are all done with a partner and aren't too difficult at all (the last lab though is a doozy). 2 midterms, which are easy if you study from the practice midterms online. Final also isn't too difficult too.",
  "I am new to computer science and that it was a good introductory class. It is about introduction to python. During lectures, Professor Kay would code which is useful for the labs, so it is useful to go to class. He is a good professor overall and very helpful if you go to his office hours.",
  "He was pretty helpful in understanding for lab assignments. Got me excited for computer science.",
  "Labs are very difficult for those who have no experience whatsoever in programming. Midterms AREN'T open note but are very easy since there are sample midterms to study off of. They're exactly like them, careful of multiple choice. Lectures are boring but are very clear. Difficult of labs easiness of lectures. Textbook VERY useful for newbies.",
  "Professor Kay is a great father-like figure perfect for me, a first year, first quarter student. He knows that you are new here and lectures, assigns, and explains accordingly. He is very knowledgable about the subject and easily answers questions. My biggest complaint is the sheer amount of examples that the lectures have, which are not helpful.",
  "Professor Kay is an excellent professor! However, the class is incredibly hard. I had to retake this class twice before I managed to get a C- . Out of the ICS 30 series, this was the hardest one. I took ICS 33 with Pattis and got an A+, but I failed this one twice. Professor Kay is overall a great professor though.",
  "Excellent professor, worth taking his class",
  "Super easy, lectures are a bit boring as the material is quite basic. Manageable weekly labs that are done using pair programming, requires little time outside of your lab period to complete. Midterm and final are also clear-cut and easy.",
  "Professor Kay is a bit boring. His lectures drag on for too long and he takes forever to explain even the simplest concepts. It is very easy though; I came in with no programming experience at all and did very well on all of his exams. Labs were a bit difficult and take a long time to complete, but they were fair.",
  "EASY. Very simple programming, although some are a little confusing. Fun. Partnered weekly projects. Lectures aren't very useful. The midterms are so simple. Not much studying required. For the final, open notes. He's always helpful and will answer any question.",
  "As long as you do and the labs (not have your partner do them for you), go to lecture, and do the practice tests he posts online, the midterms and final are a breeze. Most labs can be completed during the lab sections, so there is minimal outside work. Kay is a good professor and will teach you a lot despite the relative easiness of the class.",
  "ICS 31 with Kay was a breeze for me (had some prior programming experience). He explains things well and it was a piece of cake for me taking his class. Relatively easy midterm and final. Takes time to make sure the class understands everything and answer questions.",
  "Great professor who was fair and cared about his students. Frequently stops to answer any questions and overall a great introductory course to programming.",
  "Very helpful during midterms and exams, Also very understanding toward his students. Great class to start learning coding",
  "SUPER EASY. The midterm and final is open note, book, studyguide, old midterm (which he posts) and anything else you want to bring. The group projects are easy to BS and class isn't mandatory. book isn't necessary unless you want to make a study guide. only reason I went to class was to do other work. A for sure",
  "Class is easy, open book/note midterm and final, in class group participation, 3 group projects",
  "He's a great professor for Intro to Python. Definitely helpful and clear in presentation. You will learn a lot from him. Such a nice guy.",
  "Great first CS professor!",
  "Very helpful professor! Easy class, he really treats Intro to computing as intro to computing! Make sure to attend labs, and use those to review for the midterms and final. Very easy midterms and final if you know your stuff. Also, use the practice textbook problems. It's actually helpful to read the book.",
  "Probably one of the easier ICS professors. You can tell he's really interested in teaching the subject and making sure everyone understands. This is not the class to just try \"getting by\" in. You should really try learning the material!",
  "Very great professor. He really shows how he cares a lot about his students. Open note final, extremely easy midterms, interesting lab assignments. His lectures can drag on at times though. He's very friendly and very approachable for any sort of help. Definitely recommend!",
  "Great teacher, Goes off topic sometimes but really knows what he is doing. His midterms are way too easy. Recommended probably the easiest teacher in the 31 series.",
  "easy class. good professor. Learned a lot in his class. Take notes and quizzes are important in order to get good test scores.",
  "One of the easiest classes that I have taken at UCI so far. He sends out a recording of his lectures and his slides are all posted online. Rarely referred to the textbook. A little bit of homework and a group project that was pretty easy to BS. Open book and note midterm and final. Highly recommend this class for easy GE or credits.",
  "Lectures can feel long, and he isn't the most exciting person to listen to, but to his credit, he's not teaching a very exciting topic (in my opinion), and everything he presents he presents very clearly so anyone can understand it. Very friendly and class is pretty relaxed. Lectures are all recorded and emailed out with lecture notes every day!",
  "Tries to make a topic that is common sense seem really difficult. Lectures are very boring as a result. He also talks really weird, one second he will be yelling and the next he will be whispering, not sure why. Tests for his ICS4 class are open book open notes and fairly easy. After the first test I skipped lecture til the final, still got an A.",
  "Professor Kay is a wonderful professor. The class is definitely difficult and it's not the most riveting subject to learn. Lectures can be dry because of the content, but Prof. Kay is very helpful and good at explaining things. He's also really nice and approachable! The in class quizzes are doable but the final was a bit tough.",
  "He's really good at teaching, but his lectures are a little boring because there isn't much interaction with the students. No midterm, just weekly quizzes which were easy. Lecture seem really long, but definitely attend if you want to pass. He usually posts lecture notes online, but sometimes he doesn't so definitely go to class.",
  "Kay is a great teacher! His lectures are very understandable. The book is optional, but a little helpful if you are confused. He is very open. We had an AMAZING TA who made life so easy. My whole class worked hard and a lot of us got A's! YAY!",
  "Dr. Kay is passionate about programming and teaching and you can tell. Sometimes the lectures are slightly boring, but it is programming. He is more than willing to help you if you're having trouble.",
  "He is a very fair teacher. Keep up with the homework and you'll get an auto-A. Don't expect too much help from the TA, just ask the prof. Homework is high at the beginning and middle of the quarter, then not so much later. In lectures, he has a booming and varied speaking voice. Interesting.",
  "Great professor. Very enthusiastic about the subject, and cares a lot about the students. Even though attendance is not mandatory, it is mandatory if you wish to pass the course. Labs are time consuming and the homework is sometimes difficult, but altogether a great course!",
  "He's really nice and cares a lot about his students. Go visit him during office hours!! The attendance is not mandatory but he still wants you to come so you can learn. There's weekly quizzes and homework but no midterm. HW and labs takes quite a bit of time so don't procrastinate.",
  "had him for 41 and 42, great teacher",
  "This professor is willing to go out of his way to help students. Professor has a personal interest in the success of informatics and as such will help in any way he can. Professor is a genuinely decent guy who knows his material and does his best to provide an overarching understanding of the informatics major.",
  "Great teacher, very helpful, easy to contact and willing to help out side of class!!",
  "Very good teacher, Easy grader",
  "Since ICS21 is the first course of programming. You should take him. He is very nice! He care about his student. I learned alot from this class. If you try to do all homeworks , you are in excellent shape. Midterm and final will be base on homeworks (just a little bit harder)",
  "Very helpful, nice, knows what he's talking about. lectures can get boring at times though!",
  "&quot;Weeeeeeeeeehhhl-- that's not the answer I was looking for buuuuuut&quot; &quot;Let's get this show oon theeee roooooooad&quot;",
  "he's a great teacher. knows exactly what he wants to teach and hardly goes on tangents... which can be good or bad depending on what you prefer. but all around good guy. :]",
  "Very good professor. The extras like the Basque Hat, Interpretive Scheme Dance, and his voice definitely distinguish this professor from others. Highly reccomend to any and all, although I still hate scheme.",
  "One of the best teacher I've every had. As caring as a high school teacher, and as knowledgeable as anyone I've ever met. Great teacher, who grades relatively easy, and teaches clearly and very well.",
  "He really really knows his stuff. Very very smart man.. ICS21H is awesome.. scheme is awesome.. excellent teaching language... and you get to avoid jacobson.. heard he doesnt' teach that well.. take kay ^_^",
  "Very cool teacher. Everyone do the scheme dance!",
  "Great professor, very helpful with his students, teaches the material clearly and thoroughly during lecture.",
  "Interesting class. Discussions can get quite repetitive though. Quite an easy A.",
  "Awesome teacher. Too bad he's going to the Informatix department. If you have a chance, take a class with him! (Plus he's a lawyer; passed the bar.)",
  "Great teacher and great person in general. He let me off the hook for a slip up I made. Class discussion can sometimes get repetitive but the topics are mostly interesting.",
  "Very nice, always willing to help, almost everyone gets As! I got a B+ though, cuz I slacked like crazy. Good teacher, knows his stuff.",
  "he's a nice guy. it was a pretty typical class it seemed--not too hard nor too easy. he explained everything pretty well.",
  "Interesting reading materials for 131, sorta lame participation points, overall good lecturer and pretty fun",
  "Very good class, lectures are interesting, gives everyones As Take his class.",
  "No Comments",
  "He hands out A's like candy.",
  "great first ICS teacher, very easy on grading, almost EVERYONE gets A's...definitely take it from him, he really knows what he's talking about",
  "Varies voice. However, lectures still boring, just hope for a good TA. to teach you the stuff.",
  "Really interesting lectures, my first ICS course.",
  "TEACH THE STUFF WE NEED FOR TESTS!!! NOT THE HISTORY.",
    "I have an A-, but it was thru my own work. Online resources > class. You'll be lectured by delusional TA's that have no significant internships claiming that hwk is hard b/c it helps you learn to think for your job. I suggest taking it with an easier professor to focus on the important concepts. After 3 weeks I stopped going to lectures. Useless.",
    "Currently taking him. So far its a mix. He's not bad; but I haven't seen anyone better. Without a doubt, you will learn. Friends aren't doing so well, I only hear the bad end of it. I'm actively listening and learning w/out the stigma of the grade. You'll feel like you're for Trump *cough* Klefstad, or not. This was a consuming class most definite.",
    "Only, and I mean ONLY, take this class if you are a strong independent learner (assume you don't have a professor). His assignments are long and extraordinary. He won't teach you anything but vocabulary. As for learning implementation, you are on your own to figure it out. The first 3 assignments are a cake; but the rest you have been warned.",
    "Study his slides & homework , you still will not do well after 3rd quiz. Used to structure and clear grading criteria? He will grade you based on your talent. The homework will not prepare you. You need to look deeper and nitpick the language of topic (if you can finish the hw on time). Only take if you want a challenge & don't mind a lower gpa.",
    "Klef doesn't teach well. It is hit or miss. He is knowledgeable, and I wish so much that he would actually just talk about the material at hand, and give more direction on the HW. His instructions are unclear, HW can be frustrating, and grading questionable. Even more, this quarter for our class, he doesn't have office hours, because screw students",
    "There was so much work per week, quiz every lecture and homework every week. Having him at 8 am was the worst thing of my life \"JUST SAY YES\"! How about no.",
    "Klefstad's ICS 53 is a lot of work, but you will learn so much about systems programming. He is truly knowledgeable in this topic, but as per usual with Klefstad courses you will have to sit through many rants and raves during lecture. The course grading scheme is fair, but be prepared for mandatory labs and discussions (weekly quiz).",
    "Klefstad will make you work really hard and stretch you but he cares greatly about his student, is an amazing lecturer, very good at explaining concepts, and it's easy to pay attention in his class.",
    "The class and assignments weren't well organized. His instructions and submission instructions were often frustratingly unclear. Additionally during lecture he would often get sidetracked by irrelevant life stories, when students just want to learn. On the plus side, I felt like some of the projects did enhance my C++ foundation.",
    "Very engaging and funny, but the lectures don't teach much and homework is kind of vague. Easy content, though",
    "Not a fan of him, but he is a nice guy. Pros: grading lenient, hw helps you understand material, not too much work. Cons: lectures notes and hw vague, don't learn much in lecture, sometimes lectures on the day the hw is due so self-study beforehand, didn't really teach pointers well. Self-study and you should be able to get A.",
    "He is very humorous, enthusiastic and professional in C++. However, he sometimes deviate from the course notes and starts talking about unrelated things during lecture. 9 hw and 7 quizzes and each quiz is based on the previous hw. Anyway, it's a safe choice to take his 45C. As long as you work hard, you will be good.",
    "He is probably my favorite lecturer at UCI so far; his lectures are funny and engaging. But I don't feel as though I learned a ton in his lectures. The lectures were also a few days behind the homework assignments, so I basically had to teach myself most of the class. Towards the end, I started learning more when he did (optional) live quizzes.",
    "Alot of assignments, so good practice to become a better programmer. You learn by doing. Lecture time not useful. prof very opinionated, not afraid to humiliate students. its his room, his time. he said i love you students but I came to not believe this. fine, its hard to stand in front of a crowd everyday. somewhat scary behind smile. judgement",
    "He is hilarious, fun and a great lecturer. Before I took his class, I was told not to take it with Klefstad and I almost took Thornton's class. I didn't want to wait so I just took Klefstad, and you know what? I LOVED IT. Although he DOES talk a lot about his family and hobbies, his lectures are solid. You might spend some time on the reports tho",
    "Klefstad's lectures are always interesting and fun. The class is also fairly easy, as most of the grade comes from your quizzes and the homeworks.",
    "Klefstad tends to not teach us how to do the homework until the last minute. We're currently writing our own C++ iterators and it seems that a lot of people are confused. He is quite inactive on Piazza as well, only adding to the confusion. Take Thornton for 45C if you can; you will learn C++ better, and learn more problem-solving skills.",
    "Kleftstad is a really good lecturer, and his homeworks and labs teach you a lot. He goes at a good pace. However, he spends way too much time talking about his hobbies and his family. It would be better if he spent that time actually explaining the concepts better. You end up having to learn most of the material yourself, online.",
    "Klefstad likes to exaggerate the difficulty of his courses to keep you on your toes. He's not the most focused lecturer, but he tries to keep you engaged. The real draw to his classes is how they're organized -- no midterm, no final, late credit, all HW, quizzes, and labs. You have to be good at programming, not at test taking, to get an A.",
    "Not sure why Klefstad doesn't have a higher rating. Yes, his lectures often get sidetracked. But he's forgiving with late credit, his homeworks are good and reinforce the material, he doesn't make you take midterms or finals, and his quizzes are fair and easy to study for. He's the dream professor if you don't need to be taught how to learn.",
    "A very good guy to talk to about broad things, but not a very good lecturer. He is very energetic and enthusiastic, but that often results in him talking about actual c++ for only a quarter of the class. Most of the time he talks about unrelated things. This usually results in him giving homework answers the day before they're due to catch up.",
    "Not sure why so many people hate Klefstad. I took him for 45C and learned alot. His notes aren't great, but he gives you enough info to figure out how to do everything. His homework was HARD sometimes, but they are pretty much 100% if you complete them (unlike Thornton). He teaches of C++, so when I took Thornton's 46 it was relatively easy.",
    "He is a good person but he has some serious problems in teaching this course. He spent too much time telling jokes, about his wife and trivial things. His notewas not very clear, sometimes not accurate, had to test his codes before using them. His grading was extremely tough, both quiz and homework. Do not take it if you like a solid course.",
    "Took 3 classes with him already (31, 45C, 46) Instructions on assignments may be unclear, but I think that's only because he just started teaching 46 (at least after a long time). I find his teaching very enjoyable. Grading is pretty fair. Quizzes every lecture/week with lowest dropped allows a lot of opportunity to get a good grade. You'll learn.",
    "Lecture quizzes are open notes so take good notes in class, esp on what he says. Homework quizzes are very similar to the lab. The class was poorly managed at times, but he was dealing with students ranging in C++ skill and was trying to make the class fair for everyone. Hes caring enough to set up a review session for those needed more help",
    "Easily one of the most poorly managed classes I've taken",
    "Take him if u wanna feel lost in requirement. You will spent more time on reports than actually doing the hw. I found algorithms and graphs are cool stuff from my cc's data structure class, but UCI wont transfer it, thanks btw. and how he taught it made this class boring and unclear even though I pay more tuition ;)",
    "Just Say Yes.",
    "Professor Klefstad will make you work for your grade, but you will come out a stronger programmer for it. Take the quizzes seriously: he will deduct 5 points for every error in your hand-written code. I recommend looking over the associated homework before each quiz. Klefstad is hilarious and engaging in lecture. Just say yes.",
    "This class was pretty easy overall if you put in the effort and learned by yourself as the lectures and his notes are simply not enough to get an A in this class. His hw was kind of unorganized at times but they were easy but also boring. His quizzes were based off the hw but graded harshly (each syntax error 5% off). Easier than ics 33 tbh.",
    "Consistently sends out homework with typos and vague directions. Barely made it through 3 or 4 of the slides each lecture as he was too busy heckling students coming in late or talking about his life.",
    "Klefstad is funny, likable, and extremely knowledgeable about C++. He just is not good at conveying the information to the student. He goes quickly in lectures and basically just reads off of notes(which are large, difficult to read). Quizzes and HW are not bad, but sometimes in HW you feel lost cuz things were not gone over in lecture.",
    "He's a very enthusiastic, engaging professor in his lectures, and entertaining. Slides aren't the best/most clear, so overall teaching is just OK. Homework started out fine but as the course went on became very vague due to poor instructions and clarity. Quizzes are fair as he typically tells the topics beforehand.",
    "Professor Klefstad is a very interesting person and clearly knowledgeable. He also has a good sense of humor to help keep students more engaged in class. However, he is a poor lecturer who always goes off on tangents and when he does teach, he teaches material that's barely applicable on the homework.",
    "Quizzes are a major part of your grade, and they are usually a more challenging version of one of the questions on the homework. There is homework due every week and it's usually 7+ hours of work (unless you're a super programmer in Java, C++, Lisp, and Prolog) instructions are vague (he want's you to read his mind).Start the homework early!",
    "Professor is really nice!!",
    "very good course",
    "Professor Klefstad is awesome!! Really enjoy his classes. He can make boring stuff very interesting and you can learn a lot unconsciously. Homework needs some effort, but he always gives you enough time to finish. So don't worry, because you can finish it before due. Really recommend this course. Best professor ever!!",
    "This isn't the hardest class I've taken, but Klefstad has got to be the *worst* lecturer. He goes off on frequent tangents and refuses to teach material required on the homeworks until the day before they're due. If you're willing to study outside and not rely on him to actually teach you though, you should be mildly well-off grade-wise.",
    "Storyteller. Say Yes.",
    "I wanna to focus on discipline. Throughout the quarter, I sent him 2 emails (2nd week and 6th week, diff topics), neither of them received a response. I went to his office 1 week after I sent him the first email, he made up an (awful)excuse that his gmail didn't work properly. When my 2nd email got ignored, I know he is not the right prof.",
    "Professor could benefit the class by organizing lecture notes and giving guides to learn from for the homework assignments. Kleftstad does not understand the value of learning efficiency. Encouraging students to google answers to solve problems is a really bad habit to pass off to students, one that already has cost the software industry.",
    "Professor Klefstad makes you work very hard, but it's for good reason. You'll figure out how good of a programmer you are in his class, but in any case you'll leave a better one. Also this is one class where you won't want to miss class, not just because of the regular lecture, but because he tells the best stories.",
    "You pretty much teach yourself the whole class. He passes this off as preparing you for the real world, and it does, but the same can be said for any class where the prof doesn't teach and you have to google everything. Worst part is though he doesn't give the solution, so if you didn't get the answer you'll leave just as confused as you came.",
    "He is passionate but it seems most of him. I'm going to learn things but not going to fight with sleepy, however, he can do much well in second task than first one. Although he says Stackoverflow is waste of time but at least there arent much off-topic words as exists in his lecture. Tons of hw and quizs w/n timely feedbacks, so do piazza.",
    "JUST SAY YES",
    "I received more feedback from the T.A.s than from him. I didn't receive graded homework until the end of the quarter, and even then some didn't get graded until grades were due. I didn't understand his lectures and office hours were even worse. I get that he can't give explicit answers sometimes, but I would have appreciate more help from him.",
    "Just say yes!!! (His signature phrase). Enthusiastic teacher, not the best out there, but fair enough. Explains things moderately well, shows signs of improvement as a teacher. Class is difficult, and he's only about a third of the reason why - learning C++ in a single quarter might be a little overwhelming for many.",
    "The class lacked a clear structure because he was constantly changing the format and requirements, which was confusing at times. Other than that, the labs and homework are doable and help prepare you for the quizzes and final. He's really flexible and extends deadlines and is good at implementing student feedback.",
    "It was his first time teaching ICS 31 so the structure of the class changed about 2 or 3 times. The assignments difficult also fluctuated about 2 or 3 times as well. As someone who was completely knew to programming, you have to sink a lot of time in order to do well. He makes the class difficult so you would actually learn the material",
    "I was really salty like week0-2 since he basically taught us nothing & threw us into the abyss of compsci but after much self-learning, I appreciated him much more since I learned so much, plus as a person he's nice & lenient, he wanted his students to do well, & tells you what to study for weekly quizzes & put up with a LOT of students complaining",
    "I had no experience in coding going into the class, so I thought the class was hard right from the very beginning. I learned a lot from this class and think it is doable. I just think for a beginner's course it was a lot to take in right from the very beginning. Labs and hw are worth so much in the grade book, so just do those and you're set.",
    "Class was extremely hard at first as someone with no exp with coding, but Klefstad gives a TON of breaks to his students. He extended deadlines, dropped 2 lowest quizzes, labs/hw were graded very leniently, no midterm, and final was only worth 15% and is a guaranteed A+ if you understand the previous labs/hw. Great course overall, learned a ton.",
    "His class have no midterm no final. HW,labs count50%of your grade, basically you will get full credit if you submit it. Weekly quizzes35%and one final quiz in week10 count15%. Thats it, not an easy A but doable A. I spent 95% of my study time this quater got A-, I am not CS major.",
    "Always being passionate in his lecture. Even though somebody think he is talking about his own experience much I the lecture, still teaches all the things contained. You don't need to pay much attention to his class, and easily get A. His class has no midterms but only has several quizes which has been explained in the lecture.",
    "I think maybe Klefstad is a good teacher for professional and some students who are perfect in programming. But actually, Klefstad is really not a good teacher for beginner. He taught many basic things on lec. His HW and LAB are literally DISASTER. You should devote all of your time for his class. But he will extend the ddl of HW/LAB for students.",
    "Not very good at teaching. His sample code does not run. He teaches basics in class, but homework and labs are a lot more advanced. You will have to learn a good amount of stuff on your own.",
    "This guy is a decent teacher but his decisions in regards to homework and labs makes him complete garbage. With Klefstad, expect your lab and hw to take up basically all of your time even if you have outside help. If you don't have outside help then good luck finishing anything.",
    "The workload was a bit heavy for an intro class, but he makes a good point that this class should be hard so we don't get screwed in ICS 32. My main complaint: his instructions are VERY VAGUE. That's literally all that's keeping me from rating this guy a 4 or even 5/5. Other than that, he's a pretty great teacher. You'll learn a lot for sure.",
    "Pros: Willing to extend deadlines, dropping lowest 2 scores for quiz, no final on finals week (final quiz worth 15%). Cons: Way too difficult for an intro class (We're almost catching up to the lessons in ICS32), Lab and HW instructions are really vague and contradicts itself sometimes. TLDR: Brutal workload, but you will learn a lot and fast.",
    "really cool person ....... really bad teacher. This was one of those classes where you have to devote all your time to, even if you are taking more important/challenging courses at the same time. He is a really funny and cool guy, but the class was too frustrating and stressful, especially for an intro class.",
    "Klefstad is what everyone says: vague and frustrating. He is, however, doing that with the best intentions. That sounds odd, but it is true. He leaves room for the student to actually use their brain in order to get something done. If you're not passionate about coding, you must really hate this class. Klefstad makes it fun and challenging. 10/10!!",
    "His lecture is basically reading the notes, and his progress is a chaos. He gives \"hints\" and break down the home work lab projects during the lecture. I got the most knowledge from the lab projects and reading online tutorials. From his lecture I get only 10% of what I should know and others would be some \"hint\" or jokes about Trump.",
    "Some quiz,lab,HW problems he never covers in lecture. And his program cannot run when he does examples in front of us during lectures. Finally he just gives up and that means he does not know how to do those questions.",
    "if you are a cs major student, dont take him!!!!!",
    "Never boring. Very good speaker. Covers almost everything you need to know, but may throw a curve ball during lab that he forgot to explain. Don't attend lectures anymore because it is an 8am, but he posts all the class materials so class is going well. Grading is homework and lab, so class is an Easy A provided you actually do them. Final only 10%",
    "While he was a great professor and he was never boring, at times I felt as though his jokes were inappropriate . I was not offended but I did feel uncomfortable.",
    "Klefstad is passionate about computer science but does a bad job at teaching it. In his lectures, he talks more about his personal life/achievements more than teaching python. It's kind of discouraging for those who don't have experience yet. In lab, we're asked to use commands not even covered in lecture! Don't take Klefstad!",
    "Not good. He was talking all the time about how he hated trump and about his wife and him fishing instead of making lecture. Really. He spent at least 10 minutes of each lectures (not contigously) making jokes an interrupt student's attention heavily. Not a serious professor. Does not take education seriously, I don't care about your son stories.",
    "Would give a 0 if I could pros: funny person, interesting lectures (meaning: good jokes), chill dude cons: useless notes: short, unorganized & hardly no explanations lecture: a lot of off topic bs confusing assignments: basically no explanations, vague grading criteria useless office hours Back to Pattis this quarter, way better in all aspects",
    "He is Hilarious definitely. U will enjoy his lectures but later find out that u need to re-study all the stuff for hws and quizzes. Weekly quizzes and challenging hws push u to study. His final is all multiple choices and it is hard!(he repeats this every time in lecture) Don't miss a lecture since he tells u what's gonna be on quizzes and final.",
    "Although a little bit unconventional at times, I will always take a class with Klefstad over other professors. He really cares about the material and I really like the way he structures the quizzes and assignments.",
    "Terrible at helping students put lectures into practice. Constantly brags about his life and how \"Great\" it is. Notes are very unorganized incomprehensible when looking back for hints. The homework is really heavy, especially if you have never learned c++ beforehand. Will make you feel inadequate by telling you that he is better than you.",
    "Lost tons of sleep with 53, but I learned more than any other CS class at UCI and built foundation for future upper-divs. Klefstad is a hard ass, but he CARES about students and INSPIRES them to give it their all (gets to knowing their names too). Yes, there's gonna be tons of work, but you'll learn so much more than before if you actually try.",
    "I would give Ray a B or B+. He gives nice extra credit if you submit homework earlier and some extra credit for good answer on piazza. These extra credit helped me got an A. However, the notes aren't clear enough, you need to search many of them by yourself in order to know the C++. Lecture time isn't boring also not fun.",
    "Enthusiastic and energetic teacher. Helps solve homework labs in lecture. Provides helpful online lecture notes. My favorite ICS teacher at UCI.",
    "Lectures notes are confusing and unorangized. Says things once and doesn't explain it. He assigns ambiguous assignments and is a harsh grader when you don't meet the expectations. The final was not based on most of the material and the notes did not help. The only things that matter is what he says but he doesn't go in depth.",
    "Klefstad is unique. He hates Python, and he loves C. He wants everyone to master C. It's painful, because C is a low level language. He spends a lot of time in class to talks about his life and tries to be cool and fun. Some students enjoy this, but some think it's totally a waste of time. It's up to you to like or hate him, but he is a good guy.",
    "I am taking this course now and this professor doesn't quite understand why he is wrong. It seems like he's presuming every student in his class knows C++ like an expert. (True, there are tons of transferred students. But not all of us are!!!) He speaks so fast, and shouts out loud \"JUST SAY YES!!\" to us every single yes-no question he asks.",
    "This was a very fun class! Dr. Klefstad is hilarious, inspirational and gives great lectures. The lectures don't help much with the assignments, but you will never leave class disappointed. I relied heavily on the book and utilized his office hours as much as possible. He is very helpful and will spend a long time explaining concepts. Great class!",
    "Dr. Klefstad is by far the most inspirational professor I have ever had. I always left his lecture motivated and determined to learn as much as I can. That being said, the class isn't exactly straight forward. His slides are confusing; expect to teach yourself a lot. He's truly brilliant though! Amazing professor, tough class, absolutely worth it!",
    "This class is not hard, it really isn't. He just doesn't know the material well.",
    "Very passionate lecturer and is always willing to provide help as long as you are willing to learn. Class has a lot of work but simply because he cares for his students and wants them to learn.",
    "This was the most time consuming class I've ever taken. Having said that, I also improved in general programming ability more than I ever have in one quarter. Because of that, I'm glad I took this course with Klefstad. He's hilarious and very passionate about teaching.",
    "His lectures are not that helpful and this class is mostly lip service to its catalog description. He essentially wants to teach C and makes the class fit that goal. To be fair, he does genuinely seem to care about students, but he seems unable to articulate it well. The grader just ran automated test cases, this was abused.",
    "Talk about a complete disregard for students' time. Klefstad isn't kidding when he says he expects you to spend up to 20 hours on homework every week, and that doesn't include his timed labs and quizzes. Not a difficult class per se and he is very helpful during office hours, but you can bet that I won't ever take a class with him ever again.",
    "Whatever you do, do not take Klefstad. The worst teacher I've taken. Quizzes are peer graded, but you have to go into office hours to get it fixed (which you will, \"If it seems right then mark it wrong\"). Problem is, it would take 2 hours to see him for office hours, so I could never do it because of my class schedule. hw was unreasonable, avoid!!",
    "His first time teaching 53. It was a mess to say the least. He expected way too much time out of us to do his assignments and his instructions for them were usually vague and unclear. Also the quizzes were peer graded, which caused many grading issues He does have good intentions and is a great lecturer but the way he structured this class was bad.",
    "Difficult. HWlabs are always vague. Unless you're a wizard, you will be swamped with work every week consisting of: 1 long hw assignment, 1 lab problem you must complete in 2 hours (as well as another due later), and WRITTEN quizzes. And he doesn't post solutions for anything ever. Office hours are the only help. Good intentions, bad teacher.",
    "Klefstad is a good lecturer but the lectures will NOT prepare you for the homeworkslabs he assigns. Quizzes are peer graded. Also, his quiz directions are extremely vague and if you get a correct but different solution, he tells the students, \"Mark it wrong and they can come to office hours if they want me to fix it.\" 53 was 1000x harder than 51",
    "WORST PROFESSOR EVER. Took him for ICS 53. He had so much work, couldn't cope up with the class. Hard grader. Assignments are equivalent to 10 classes taken together. If you take 53 with him, you will end up failing all the other classes cause you won't have any time for to work on them. Doesn't understand students have other classes and a life.",
    "So this class is essentially broken up into two parts - the lectures and the labs. I say two parts because they feel distinct, unlike other ICS classes. I gotta say, Klefstad is great, but sometimes the material isn't explained in the best way. And the labs aren't too bad overall, but they can be frustrating. The Rolodex lab is just TOO LONG.",
    "Great lecturer, extremely disjointed class. I learned more in this class than I have in most of my courses, but be prepared to work for your grade.",
    "Klefstad admitted this was his first time teaching the ICS 51 material, and it showed. Lectures didn't correlate with quizzes and he couldn't even help us with certain things. Thankfully though, he recognized this and slowed down, admitting that it was too hard. So all was good at the end. He is otherwise a great professor and knowledgeable.",
    "His lectures are pretty useful for the homework and quizzes. The homework varies in difficulty, so you should get started on it as soon as possible(especially for pure Python programmers) to avoid headaches or turning in the assignment late. Quizzes are based on HW Gave option for multiple choice final(HARD) or regular quiz style final",
    "When the average for the second quiz is a 35%, you know something is wrong. This class is broken. Dr. Klefstad openly admits that hardware is not his area of expertise, and it shows. His lack of communication with the TA's make studying for exams impossible. It is a shame, since he seems like a very nice guy, just not a very good professor.",
    "Great person, great sense of humor, and seems he has an awesome life. Lectures were interesting at times but not helpful; It's like he would teach us 1+12 and send us home to derive the mass of an electron using strong induction and relativity laws. However, if you've taken way more classes than ICS 33, it's an easy A with some self-teaching.",
    "The worst class i have ever taken.",
    "Said at the beginning that textbooks were not required. Later said that they were, after they were no longer easily available. HW and quizzes had nothing to do with lecture. The TA's apparently wrote all the assignments, and he had nothing to do with them. He also lied occasionally about his interactions with the TAs. Average on tests was about 30%",
    "Be prepared to study. You will have to go all over the place to find information, because for HWLabs, they will not provide the information needed to complete the assignments. They are helpful when you ask for clarificationinformation, but will not provide all the tools needed to complete assignments effectively.",
    "agreed. fast-paced, lots of material to cover, but definitely worth it! you work your butt off but the class gives you a rock-solid foundation for the programming classes to come. it's been awhile since i've taken this class, but it's the only one i truly enjoyed and am grateful to have had him as a prof.",
    "My first ICS class 8 years ago was ICS21 with Dr. Klefstad. He may not know it, but it was his class that made me who I am today, a very successful Enterprise Architect for a huge consulting company. Yes, the class was tough and alot of people failed...but the lessons learned from failure became the key to my success. His class was invaluable.",
    "Best professor I've ever had.",
    "I owe pretty much everything that I know about coding from this guy. He's the best professor I have ever had even though I failed his ICS21 class the first time, but I came back with an A. haha",
    "Very tough class. He's somewhat of a condescending jerk at times...but he somehow manages to teach you the material better than anyone. If you want to LEARN about programming, he's the guy to take.",
    "His lectures include interesting stories which help maintain your attention to the lecture. He knows his material VERY well. He teaches it VERY well. And, he tells you exactly what will be on the exams. He helps you alot with HW's as well.",
    "Arguably the best professor I've ever had. Knows the material extremely well. If you want to be ready when you graduate, this prof is the one that will prepare you.",
    "He is good at making ppl laugh. He makes jokes all the time in lecture and they are enjoyable, but it eats up lecture time. His attention diverts easily in lec & converstaion. I Had three of my classes with him in ICS, he has much demands for hw & tests.",
    "198 turned into 144. he was easy on us for some reason, but he's a great professor. keeps you interested, motivated, and teaches well. we stole him from ics, lol",
    "dr klefstad was an extremely tough professor. i must have spent more nights in the computer lab than out partying with my friends because of him. but overall, i know what i know now because of him.",
    "Awsome Teacher...",
    "This guy taught me the programming skills i have..and I am a good programmer. All he does in lecture is tell stories....very difficult, but funny. Take him if you are serious about your career.",
    "Great professor. Tough grader but well worth taking",
    "Lots of stories, hear the one about nitrogen narcosis&#63; Great teacher, knows his stuff. If you work hard listen to him. You'll do fine. Teacher of the year(7)!",
    "Hard to gauge...has reputation of being really hard, but he was somewhat easy of ECE144...tests and programs are relatively easy...GREAT lecturer.",
    "ohmigosh... i learned to program from this guy. hard but shoot. U WILL LEARN! powerpoint notes online very cool.",
    "fun prof... but wish the class were a little more involved...",
    "No Comments",
    "His test are kinda of hard but it is a fun class",
    "Awesome teacher! Class is lots of fun",
      "If you like a CS prof to type 1 word per min, then this is the guy for you. I had no idea what was going on in lecture because he's so dry. If you like reading 30 page novels for notes, then this is the guy for you. But his in-lab exams weren't that bad tbh",
      "Notes are LONG but VERY informative and Pattis explains concepts really well. Class is organized, instructions extremely clear, and grading fair. Lots of homework BUT worth it. The key to doing well is to read all the notes, and start EARLY on assignments. HIGHLY recommend because you will learn a lot! Best professor I've had so far.",
      "All professors should be like Pattis, very well organized , gives you all the knowledge you need in his very long and specific notes, his website has all the due dates and he is always in constant communication with the students so youll never not know whats going on. A TON of work but It is worth it in the end , you walk out knowing a lot more.",
      "Pattis is a great professor. Despite all the work he gave throughout the quarter (5 Programming Assignments, 8 Take-Home Quizzes, 2 Lab-Exams, Midterm, Final), he actually makes you learn. All the work is aimed to help you understand Python a lot better which will be very useful.",
      "Overall a great CS Professor. Workload is heavy, quizzes nearly every week, programming assignments every 2 weeks, 2 in lab exams usually around week 4 and 8 and a midterm and final. Although workloads heavy, it makes you master the material and become a better python programmer. Midterm and final are fair. If you put in the work, youll get an A.",
      "Long notes. Heavy load. Unreasonable policies. Avoid him if you can.",
      "The course is not bad, but the workload is relative heavy. About 2 coding assignments need to do pre week, and 4 Test (2 in-lab, midterm, final). If you do not have good skill in coding before taking this class, your enthusiasm for cs will reduce after this class. The midterm and final is not hard, but you will lose point easily.",
      "A lot of work but help you learn a lot...",
      "If you are planning to take the class, DON'T. All your free time will be spent coding :). Your life will revolve around this class Funny guy, loves Pinterest. You is welcome",
      "Awesome sauce!",
      "Pattis's classes could be good, but he's no Klefstad. He's uncompromising, demanding, and unforgiving. His class isn't HARD -- merely stressful and unpredictable. If you're well-organized and good at meeting stringent deadlines, you'll probably pass easily. I fell into major depression the quarter I took his class, so long story short, I wasn't.",
      "Pattis is an inspirational professor. His lectures are worth going to, you can't miss those days when he cracks a legendary CS joke. He genuinely understands the students and his grading scheme is quite generous.",
      "Organized, knows what's he doing, knowledgable. Boring though.",
      "What a god. Best prof at uci.",
      "I loved ICS 33 with Pattis. He is very clear with how he grades your work; he gives you all the tests to run for your code. His notes are ugly, but super informative. I genuinely feel like I learned so much about Python after taking this course. You need to put in the work (weekly quizzes, a project every two weeks, etc), but it pays off.",
      "Lots of hw,yes. But everything else is fair. He gives you all the tests that he uses to grade your hw and quiz. If you really work hard, how can you get a terrible score on these parts? And one below who said lab exam is hard---did you even do the sample exam? Mid and final are not easy but he curves a lot and only about 35% of your total grade.",
      "Lots of tests: 8 take-home quizzes, 2 in-lab exams, one midterm and one final. Attending lecture is not always required (sometimes you have to hand in some stuff in the lecture); Pattis just reads out his super long notes in the lecture (although the notes are useful). If you did well in ICS 32, ICS 33 will not be hard.",
      "Professor Pattis is the pinnacle of ICS at UCI. This man has an incredible class structure and is very organized. People consistently talk about his workload, but it is easily manageable if you start early and don't procrastinate. Help is easily accessible if you need it. Midterms and Finals are more than doable if you actually read his notes.",
      "Pattis' class is really organized. Lecture is not much more than reading the notes, unfortunately. Fair grading and testing criteria.",
      "Heavy but consistent workload, which allows you to get into the \"flow\" of work. Planning ahead is a must, and everything else will be manageable!",
      "Heavy workload but you'll learn a lot. Very organized and clear on expectations - can guarantee 100% on programming assignments by checking against the provided batch self check tests. Written exams are dense, but in the end due to the written exams not weighing heavily around 40% of the class ends up with As.",
      "The class is a ton of work, largely due to the reading material. However, the reading material really feels purposeful and valuable, explaining key Python concepts better than almost any other reading material I've read. If you always start reading and working on assignments WELL in advance, you'll do fine. He's very knowledgeable and it shows.",
      "Heavy workload in this class but it's really unavoidable with any 46 professor. Very tough tests, programming assignments are implementations of c++ STL and he provides you with google tests that help a lot. I gained a lot from this class but it also seems like a bit heavier of a workload than Thornton. Take-home quiz every week. Lecture optional",
      "Best ICS professor I have met so far. His basic self check program is really helpful for project. It's easy to keep track of your grade in his class. I did not feel any difficulties writing code in this course. However, written midterm and final exam need to be treated with cautious.",
      "Only some of his lectures are somewhat helpful, but not many. However, he provides more than enough resources to do well in the course. His website is like an encyclopedia, but you get used to it. Overall, the amount of detail and work is overwhelming, but if you can get past it, you will become a great python programmer.",
      "It's a lot of work, but you learn a lot. The grades are heavily skewed towards if you put in enough time into your assignments, around 50% of the grade is based on programming assignments &amp; take home quizzes. So it's pretty easy to get a good grade in the class, if you put in the time. Not good at lecturing though, just reads off notes",
      "Very touch exams. You will be asked to write several functions on paper and pencil on midterm and final exam.",
      "Very tough class! Quizzes are mind wrecking, programming assignments are long, in lab exams are not very easy either and written exams are quite hard. Lecture is not very helpful because he only reads through his super long notes but his notes are important for written exams. I am glad I passed his class in one go. It was very stressful.",
      "He made everything so difficult for students. Lots of homework, quizzes, in lab exams, midterm, final...... It doesn't feel like this is a 4 unit class. Maybe 8 units looks like more reasonable. lecture doesn't help on anything. Notes are super long and not straightforward.",
      "His class is A LOT of work. There's a quiz nearly every week and the program assignments are lengthy, just like his lecture notes. I do like how he provides code so you can check whether or not your programs are doing what it's supposed to do. The in-lab exams are easier than the written tests for this reason. He's definitely knowledgeable.",
      "Pattis' class is difficult, but his teaching is very good. His notes are super long, but they have all the info you need, so read the notes!! Individual assignments and tests are curved. He provides pictures and in-class stuff for some concepts, which is nice. Office hours get super packed tho. A lot more work than other classes, but still doable.",
      "I dont like him. He gives the way too many works and it makes students hard to breathe. Especially for me who is not very good on programming. However, I have to read the notes very fast in order to submit my homework on time. I devote all of my times to this course. I always finish my work by midnight, but I got a very bad grade. I am so sad.",
      "Professor Pattis has really really really long notes and you will receive a passing grade just by reading his notes. His extra credit policy encourages students to work on problems early, and students who submitted early actually have higher grades. His exams are hard, but if you understand course material very well you should be able to get an A.",
      "Professor Pattis is an amazing lecturer. His lectures are clear and if you have questions, he's very helpful during his office hours. His grading criteria is very clear and his notes are amazing. All of his notes are in .txt but still are very well formatted and complete. Read his notes and you won't regret it. His tests are fair.",
      "Very very hard class! Be ready to study extremely hard. The work takes you most of free time!!!",
      "If you're a committed reader and notetaker, you can pass the class without going to lecture since lectures are dull. With that said, Pattis's class covered topics that I have been asked in many of my interviews for jobs. He teaches material thoroughly (though his notes are loooong) and in a way that you retain the knowledge for a long time.",
      "Pattis and his long notes are very informative, and I did learn a lot. The quizzes and projects are not difficult but the class is a constant grind and there is a lot of material to go through, so it will be easy to fall behind. The midterm and final leave no time for thinking so you need to know your stuff",
      "I took Pattis for my first quarter at UCI. I had failed to learn anything useful at my community college and, through no fault of his own, was completely lost at first, but after attending many office Pattis helped me become much more confident and I felt so much better prepared for the coming quarters.",
      "It's really really hard, I will never take this class before",
      "I loved this professor. However, It helps that I love computer science. If you come ready to learn, Pattis will teach you so much and you will become a lot more confident in your coding abilities. Do all the work and projects and the class is easy! Although the notes were a bit intimidating, I enjoyed every lecture. Loved this professor!",
      "I liked him for ICS 33 for the most part, but then taking him for ICS 46 was terrible. Glad he doesn't teach upper div.",
      "Read his notes. Pattis gives you all the information that you need to succeed in the course in his massive course notes. They are dense, but you can use CTRL + F to search specific terms. The programming projects can be difficult but he gives you the tests he will run so you can know exactly what your score will be.",
      "Pattis is more cut out to be a researcher than an instructor. Although he knows what he's talking about and tries to inform his students the best he can, his notes and lectures are convoluted and extremely cumbersome to read. Additionally, he will assign labs and quizzes at the same time (like ICS31), but it will feel like a VERY heavy workload.",
      "ahPattis with his 99c whiteboard. Pattis honestly was born to teach, really puts in the effort of preparing his materials, his lectures were,lets just say, not the most interesting. batch self checks make everything clearcut if not easy. does care for students though cynical at times. work is needed but rewarding, and doesn't take insanely long.",
      "Amazing and respected professor. The class needs daily work and can't be learned just before the midterm. The final was a bit harder than expected and should not be taken lightly.",
      "His lectures are bloated and boring (and he is in desperate need of a whiteboard that doesn't look diseased), but his assignments and quizzes are pretty easy - if you follow along with his overly long notes online, you should be able to get the assignments done and pad your grade with the early turn-in extra credit",
      "Reads off of the 8-font lecture notes in large blocks of text and does his best to explain things that aren't obvious. Guy doesn't smile much. Class is fair and a little tricky, but not impossible.",
      "Had him for 33 ,46. My opinion of him improved from 33 to 46, even though the class structure is the same. If you can keep up, you will learn so a lot, but the workload is intense (quizzes take time, but aren't outrageous. Programming assignments (for 46) are pretty hard.) I REALLY wouldn't recommend taking a heavy course load with him.",
      "Attendence is optional, but you better show up. His lectures weed out the massive manual that he calls \"lecture notes\" down to what you need to pass the class. Yes, he is a jerk sometimes, but I highly respect him because he is a walking encyclopedia. If you are passionate about coding, it will be very possible in getting a high A. Otherwise... gl",
      "He is a lousy lecturer with an off-putting attitude. His lectures just consist of scrolling through and reading his verbose plain text file notes. Heavy workload, with a weekly take home quiz and biweekly programs. It is pretty easy to get an A in the class if you do the work - the grading system weighs the homework heavily (also batch self check)",
      "His lecture notes are the primary source of content, but are massive walls of text - his writing style is INCREDIBLY verbose, and his lecture notes have no formatting beyond ASCII drawings. So they are a pain to read. There is also a constant stream of work - labs, quizzes, in-lab exams, written exams. You will learn, but it will be painful.",
      "I took this class along with Math 3A and Informatics 43. All my attention and time went into this class. Must read notes to pass. Didn't really like his lectures too much since he just read over the the novels for each week.",
      "be prepared to spend a lot of time in this class. he assigns a programming assignment that is long and then there are also quizzes every week. he doesn't provide much help when you ask. you dont get a lot of time when you do the midterm. he is just a hard professor who doesn't take into consideration how many other classes you're taking.",
      "you have to read a lot and there is no summarized version or note. I like coding but I had hard time reading his stuff and it was extremely boring.",
      "After taking 45c with Klefstad and 51 with alfaro, I felt that Pattis is one of the best professors in CS. At least, we have notes to read and clear assignment instructions :)))",
      "Pattis is a clear professor, and gives students a lot of work. The students should not fear the workload he gives, especially if you are passionate about programming. He gives you the chance to expand your knowledge beyond what was learned in 32 or 31. His challlenges easily made me a better programmer by far. Get ready to read (or skim) his notes.",
      "Beginning of the course there was a ton of reading to do, however as the course went on the amount of work lessened. The same goes for the programming assignments and quizzes that are due every other and every week, respectively.",
      "Reads from his notes during lecture so it really isn't necessary to go. How you really learn is from sorting through the notes yourself to do the quizzes and programs. If you have a mostly clear understanding of how to do them, you'll be fine. It's not hard to get a good grade since bsc tells you exactly how your code should work.",
      "Pattis has a way of explaining his core points in each lecture, and they are full of information you will use in the exam and labs. Honestly, the biggest lessons do not come from the readings (although there is A LOT of dense information), it comes from doing all the exams and programs correctly and understanding what is going on.",
      "The guy is an egotistical jerk. AVOID AT ALL COSTS! Falsely accused of cheating (exonerated from all charges) heard from others that he tends to falsely accuse people so be careful when you code. He also reads from his notes in lecture so theres no point in showing up. The work is alright, just a lot of work.",
      "A lot of reading, even during the class. Yes, he just reads his notes during the class.",
      "Do the quizzes on your own. Sorting through the information on the readings while trying to find the answers to them really helps you in the long run. Having those checks on the programs makes it easy to get an A on the projects. I would've taken more care to read if I could. Be sure to at least skim the readings before written test. GO TO LECTURE",
      "This class itself is not hard. However, with his fantastic teaching skill, I understand xxxx in this class. I participated in some online programing training programI. benefited a lot from it and I gained confidence of programming. However, with Pettis ,I lost all my confidence. He just bullied you academically by using his authority. Great !",
      "Professor Pattis is a good professor if you actually listen in class and read his lecture notes. Although they are quite dense, his notes provide very useful information for quizzes and programming assignments. The workload was very intense with weekly quizzes and programming assignments every two weeks. And asking questions really helps a lot!",
      "Easy class, but boring. Pattis is the type of guy who does a lot of hand holding and writes long ass instructions for each assignment; but because of this, a lot of people don't even read them and might have trouble with the labs/quizzes. His online notes are long and disgusting, Google is way more useful.",
      "Somewhat dull lectures. Insane amounts of notes, so finding important things or knowing EVERYTHING you should isn't really feasible. Most of class is not based on paper tests, and assignments can be gauranteed to 100% (batch self check). So, getting an A is rather easy, since most of grade is free. Quantity quality in examples unfortunately",
      "Be ready to work many hours for this class. It's called ICS 33 because it will take 33 hours of work per week from you to get through it. Do well on the in lab exams and you should be good based on program 1 and 2. Midterm was alright. Final was super hard.",
      "Worst teacher ever. Let's not talk about his quizzes, assignment or exams, because these help students with their growth. However, his notes are very hard to understand due to his grammatical errors and writing style. He also have some ridiculous policies regarding his class. I highly suggest avoiding this teacher.",
      "Hardest class I've taken in my undergraduate class and a lot of students will blame it on Pattis but in reality they just couldn't step up to the plate. Pattis cares so much about his students, and was so reassuring when I visited office hours. Rare to find such genuine professors. He knows his material and the notes kill but you learn so much.",
      "Amazing lecture, you can learn everything by just going to the lecture. Not much assignments, they have really clear instructions and they are not hard at all. Midterms and finals are easy As, as long as you go to his lectures. His notes are straight, short and simple, make sure you read them WORKD BY WORD. Great teacher! Can't wait to take ics 46!",
      "pattis is a homie. gives a lot of work, but you'll learn so much from the class. each lecture he publishes a separate novel worth of notes. which you HAVE to read in order to do the quizzes and the midterm. my god the midterm. was like 9 pages long in 50 minutes. btw his c++ is nooby af he never deletes anything, but pattis is very intelligent",
      "People are cheating their way through the class whether it is by addy or through past solutions. This guy is evil. People are taking drugs to pass this class. Students are not learing, they are just memorizing and taking test. No wonder UCI ICS students don't find jobs after school. Apple and Google are recruiting from cal polys and UCSD and UCB",
      "His detailed notes (skim them) are mostly what you need to do well. If you skip lecture, you can make up for it by reading, but it saves time to just attend. You can find most of what you need for quizzes/programs in the notes. Give yourself at least 3 days to work on them. Use bsc! Grades fairly. Written exams test concepts, in-lab tests debugging",
      "He writes a TON of in-depth notes that may save your ass during the quarter, making the textbook essentially useless -- don't buy it. Our class had weekly \"quizzes\" aka homework, bi-weekly programming assignments, 2 in-lab exams, 1 midterm, and a final. Overall, expect a lot of reading & work in general. Pattis will take up a lot of your free time.",
      "Quizzes are so hard. Exams are even harder. I cannot handle it. But the professor is very nice.",
      "Be aware that Pattis is super anal and may accuse you of cheating regardless of if you cheated or not. Be prepared to spend lots of hours outside of class finishing assignments. Good curve and gives a little bit of extra credit. Provides notes which is helpful. Google is truly your friend in this class.",
      "Pattis is not a good lecturer but his notes are comprehensive and you can learn A LOT by reading them. Doing so will get you a good grade in the class and it won't be necessary to attend his lectures. Also, his class is a lot of work, so choose classes with a lighter workload. His class is fun except the weekly quizzes can be annoying at times.",
      "Program 2,3,4 are too hard(1 and 5 are easy). Tests and quizzes are fair. A lot of work but worth it.",
      "You are expecting taking two classes at once with extremely unclear quizes, programs and exams. This guy literally is reading his lecture note during lecture. You will spend your entire life doing his program assignment and not even 10% of it is gonna be on the exam. It's not a hard class, but he makes it extremely confused with his own error/fault",
      "This class can be frustrating and there is a decent amount of work. If you want an A, you need to follow all of his IDE (Eclipse) setup instructions, read all of his lecture notes (make sure you highlight all the important parts for reference), and start programming assignments as soon as possible (there will be a lot of bugs). Have fun :)",
      "Be ready to deal with buggy code, and spend more time figuring out how to get his library to work than actually programming. If you are not an expert in linking c++ libraries, you have to use Eclipse on Windows or you will double your headaches. If you can, take any other professor for this class. Also class is not curved.",
      "TOOOO MANY WORK! HARD EXAMS! MEAN ATTITUDE.",
      "This class was a challenge. 8 quizzes, 2 in-lab exams, 5 projects, a midterm, and a final. He tells you exactly what he wants by giving a self check program. Projects are fun. The midterm and final are going to be tough. the in-lab exams are basically knowing how to program without google. The quizzes were the worst, they were a nightmare.",
      "Definitely a knowledgeable professor, but many people had difficulty with the class. Make sure you study and go to lecture for the most part or you will be completely out of the loop when it comes time for tests.",
      "I fell in love with programming after taking ICS 31 and having Pattis introduce me to it. He takes you from never having used more than Microsoft word to being somewhat decent in Python. Dont get me wrong this class is by no means easy at all its very time consuming, but it is clear, fair, and you will come out of it KNOWING what you learned well.",
      "Pattis is a very knowledgeable professor. He is very helpful. But his lectures are dull and boring. And his notes are way too big to read. This class is not hard, but it is too much work for 4 units. 8 quizzes, 5 projects, 2 in-lab programming exams, midterm and final. Quizzes will haunt you the most.",
      "Tough class, I'm second language, so it's like hell. Advice: Read, summarize the notes, do ALL assignments. Love: All the materials he taught, really cool and helpful. Hate: Everything else. My feeling: sometimes I like him, sometimes I hate him so much I feel like I'd better drop the class. Thanks god I go till the end.",
      "Definitely a tough class. Pattis is a pretty good teacher, but sometimes rambles in lecture. Make sure to pay attention because plenty of students failed this class.",
      "Lectures aren't very fun, they tend to drag on and most people get distracted. A lot of the compsci taught in the class is more abstract than previous ICS classes. Weekly quizzes, along with a lab program due every 2 weeks. Regardless of the work load and lectures, Pattis is actually REALLY good at teaching and you will learn a lot.",
      "Pattis' ics33 is really tough, but CS is a tough thing itself. His quizzes are helpful but some of the programming assignments are not related to the lecture material at all. He is not a fair grader. He only grades according to the number of incorrects. But you can really learn a lot of things if you pay attention to this course. I love Pattis.",
      "The lectures are really boring for a majority of the time. He never writes any actual code. Just reads through lecture notes an sometimes draws some diagrams. WAY too much homework. If you take ics33 with Pattis, make sure the rest of your classes have a fairly easy workload. You need to dedicate most of your time outside of class to his homework",
      "Ok, I have already read some reviews about Pattis for ICS 33. Even though there are a lot of bad reviews about his class, I still think he is one of the best professor who teaches in his own way. His lecture is decent, but his notes are AMAZING!!! Like seriously, if you read the notes at least 2 times, you will learn a lot and do well in his class.",
      "Can't recommend. He's not bad; you can tell he loves what he's doing but I feel that he's really inefficient at teaching it. He takes pages to teach about a topic that could have been explained in a few paragraphs. His lectures are really boring and maybe 25% attend. Maybe he should've been a writing professor because this guy can write for days.",
      "Never have I been more frustrated- his assignments are scary. Weekly quizzes and labs. He REALLY likes to write. There's a lot to read, and you've got to read very closely or you'll miss out on crucial details. Can I stress HE WRITES A LOT. YOU WILL BE READING. A LOT. THIS IS A STRESSFUL CLASS.",
      "Long notes that aren't very clear. Assignments and quizzes are very wordy and can be misinterpreted easily especially for non-english speaking students. Boring lectures. Class is not impossible to do well in but it will consume a lot of your daily life so be prepared for that. Very useful office hours but lectures can make you fall asleep.",
      "By no means is this an easy class. There's lots of works so if you can manage it whilst doing the reading, you'll be fine. Reading his notes is essential as most of the questions on the final are based off those readings. Assignments took a lot of my time, but it was well worthed at the end. Take only if you have time to spare!",
      "Pattis seems to love teaching and he's really good at it. Assigns a good amount of work, but it never feels unfair.",
      "The more times I take a course with Pattis, the more I begin to appreciate what he has to offer as lecturer. His notes are thorough, his grading criteria is clear, and he is quick to answer any questions you ask him. Yes, he is very traditional in terms of teaching style, and his exams can run a bit long, but he does his job and he does it well.",
      "Good luck, that's all I have to say. Thankfully the notes help immensely with the quizzes and programming assignments, but they are novels in and of themselves and written in plaintext. His lectures consist of him literally reading his notes from the website. Make sure to start the assignments EARLY as there will be many bugs in your code.",
      "His lectures aren't very interesting but he makes up for it with his very thorough notes. If you read his notes, you can do all the assignments for this class. Assignments are reasonably challenging but his tests expect you to do a lot in a short amount of time.",
      "Garbage class. Taught material not even relevant to the course, and built his own data structure library to use for the course, which barely worked and had multiple issues. The course should have been named \"How not to make Data Structures and algorithms\".",
      "Usually dry lectures, but he can be funny if he wants. His whiteboard demonstrations really help visualizing concepts, so I recommend attending lectures for them. Assignments are doable, although 3 out of 5 of them are basically the same thing. Exams are very difficult. You can get by with his notes, but be aware they're long (albeit thorough).",
      "His notes are dry but more easier to follow than his lecturing. He answers emails quickly and is always willing is to help. However, there's weekly quizzes and long assignments so be prepared to put time into the class if you don't pick up things smoothly. Eclipse is awful but you need to use it for testing your programs in this class.",
      "This class should just be called Pattis Structures and Algorithms, bc of the assignments alone. Your basically implementing a linked list version of every array structure that he gives you. Pattis also has really poor C++ skills. Memory leaks everywhere for the sake of shortening code. You might learn some theory, but no applicable C++",
      "Here's the bottom line. This course's name should be changed from \"Data Structures\" to \"How Eclipse Gives You Depression.\" Don't get me wrong. The actual concepts you learn in this course are pretty useful, but the real challenge is trying to use the awful (and I mean AWFUL) Eclipse environment. And if you have a Mac it's about 1000x more painful.",
      "Lectures are very boring. Weekly quizzes that are like mini programming assignments. In addition to large programming assignments due every 2 weeks, usually having to do with implementing a data structure. He uses Eclipse, which is very annoying to work with! I had so many problems using Eclipse on my Mac and some programs wouldn't even compile.",
      "This class was honestly one of the easiest classes I have taken here at UCI. If you had Professor Kay for ICS 31 and thought he was easy, you have not seen ICS 33 with Pattis yet. This is an easy A. I took this to fulfill my GE's and it was a breeze. Would take again.",
      "tough teacher, tons of work to do like we dont have other class",
      "One word: dry. But if you can get past this, then he is very thorough. If you pay attention, you will learn A LOT. As for workload, it's pretty tough. Programming ain't easy, but if you make use of the message board he has and really get in the zone, you will do well.",
      "Very difficult class if you enroll without any prior knowledge to programming. His pace is very quick and gives large amounts of work that will keep you busy either doing his work or studying for the exams.",
      "Honestly not impossible to pass. Just that between his take-home quizzes and labs, he gives an WAY too much work. His workload (as well as work from other classes) makes being able to go through all of his extremely verbose (yet helpful) online notes impossible. He could teach the class in a much simpler way, but is instead wordy and ambiguous.",
      "Professor Pattis is an excellent teacher. His assignments and exams are very fair, and he does a great job answering any questions you have and making sure you have access to all the materials you will need for the course. The only real problem I have with Pattis is that his attitude makes him not very likeable, despite his ability to teach well.",
      "Lectures are dry and gives lots of assignments but gives lots of chances to improve; lots of extra credit and replaced midterm score with final score. He gives you the test script they grade programs with so you know you're right. If you're new to or not serious about programming, you'll probably be mowed down by his timed in-lab programming exams.",
      "Very very boring and pointless class, avoid at all costs if you do not have programming experiance. You will not do well.",
      "I came into this class to spend time on programming not to spend time trying to understand his labs. I have lost all interest in programming this quarter because his lab assignments are not clear at all! All the time spent understanding his assignments on top of all the work he gives leads me to believe that he doesn't think we have other classes.",
      "WARNING! DO NOT TAKE! This professor is the WORST! The best analogy of this class (as described by multiple successful upper division computer science students) is like \"teaching algebra to a kindergartener\". His bar/pace is so high that it is literally impossible to pass without cheating or having prior experience. Avoid at all costs.",
      "This class wasn't the easiest, but I think Pattis is an excellent teacher. It was challenging in a good way. The tests are hard, but he gives plenty of opportunities for extra credit here and there. He always keeps students updated, which is nice.",
      "Boring class.",
      "Lab assignments are confusing. I do not know what he wants.",
      "This class will keep you busy throughout the week but you will learn a lot. Do not procrastinate on lab assignments and do well on quizzes and you'll pass. Nice prof but dry lectures. LARC helped me through those topics I didn't understand in pattis' lecture.",
      "Very fair grader. Extra credit opportunity if you turn in assignments early, curves well. Exams are tricky but studying is minimal. He tests mostly on how well you understand the main topics he outlines for each exam. He responds to e-mails in minutes. Very nice guy. Programming projects (except for the last one) were boring, long, but rewarding.",
      "Charismatic professor with an incredible amount of knowledge, and not just in his field. Can seem a bit abrasive in lecture, but is a nice guy if you get a chance to talk to him. If you understand the material, you're fine. If not, make a point not to fall behind.",
      "Lectures are super boring.",
      "PATTIS IS AMAZING. He's an extremely systematic and organized professor. He REALLY helps the students as best as he can with OH, online OH, being there during lab, etc. His class is tough, no doubt about it. But his grading scheme is MIRACULOUS. It evens everyone out. I ended up with a B even though I had a C- at some point during the class.",
      "It's 6 units, so you need to put in some time. Weekly quizzes (kinda tough) weekly programming assignments (worth most of your grade. if you know what you're doing, they're easy & you can get EC on them). Midterm is EXACTLY the quizzes. Final is basically the last 2 (of the 6) programming assignments. Fun Class. Not Hard. I wish i tried on quizzes.",
      "6 unites class. if you have no computer science experience, AVOID AT ALL COST. the amount of work (weekly quiz, weekly programming assignment) will take all of your free time away. The exams are all written exams. So no MCQ.",
      "He's a fantastic teacher and his class really isn't that hard. His midterm and final are brutal but they're curved a ton to make it fair. He's really friendly and his lectures are interesting.",
      "Honestly, you need to put time into this class, but that shouldn't stop you from taking it. I hate how students only care about how easy a class is. I would think students attend college to LEARN something. But as I can see, that is not the case.",
      "If it takes you more than 2 hours to finish the 1st quiz, drop the class. Also, programming assignments take more than 2 hours sometimes me and my lab partner spent 2 days working on them, and my partner was almost going to graduate as a math major. when we asked for help, we just got hints from the TA and Pattis.",
      "Incredible instructor. The class is a *lot* of work, so be prepared, but all the of the assignments, quizzes, and exams ensure you thoroughly understand the course concepts. Tons of notes and diagrams available on his website to supplement/replace the textbook. He has many office hours for answering questions, and answers email often too.",
      "He is a good but hard professor. If you really want to learn,take his class, you will learn a lot. there are 5 programs,weekly quiz, two lab exam,midterm and a final. Midterm and final is hard so you need to do really well on programming and week;y quizes.",
      "really disliked the teacher. he knows the stuff really well n amazing but his teaching style isnt the best. all the lecture notes are atleast 10 pages long boring boring boring..",
      "One of the best professors. There is a lot of work, but if you work hard you'll be fine.",
      "Definitely a lot of work. Take-home quiz every weekend (trust me, not easy at all), 4 programming exams, 6 programming assignments, midterm, and final. You don't have to buy a textbook because he basically wrote out the entire textbook on his website.",
      "Overall I'd recommend. Explains things well and is always willing to help, I learned a lot in his class. That being said he does move through material pretty fast. If you are taking ICS 6(the excel course) for G/E reqs I would not recommend taking him unless you are willing to work as his class is not a walk in the park like most other G/E's.",
      "A very experienced professor who genuinely cares about his students. The workload for the course is no joke though. Labs are confusing at times, midterms are challenging, and there are weekly quizzes which feel like minilabs in themselves. However if you take the class seriously and work hard, you'll feel very prepared for upcoming cs classes.",
      "Pattis is a very experienced professor and that is why I was so shocked the class performed so poorly under him. His lectures are very boring and he constantly made insults about the students right in front of our faces! Also he promised to bring doughnuts to lab, and never did! Also he stares at the back wall during lecture....creepy.",
      "An overall great professor. He responds quickly to email, posts scores for all quizzes/hw/tests online, and is very willing to help students. Only negative: Midterm and Final are too difficult, but his grading is very fair. Work hard on homework and quizzes and you won't have to worry about the exams. The textbook was never used, don't buy it.",
      "Great professor - has a bunch of resources available. If you zone off during lecture, you can just read it online because he posts all his lectures and they are extremely detailed. Gives a take-home quiz every week that is extremely helpful if you take the time to do it. Labs took forever. Very time consuming class, but I learned so much!",
      "Java... o-ho-ho-ho... Hard class, lecture is 3 hrs long, and boring... After an hour - impossible to understand what he's saying. Labs are easy at first, but then they get harder. Programming exams are good though. Final and Midterm - too long, don't relate to class. His name - Richard - is the best way to describe his personality, you know ^^",
      "Extremely good! Gives lots of information in lecture - usually more detail than on tests. Highly knowledgeable and interested in the subject. The material was difficult, but he gives plenty of EC and his exams are very fair, and he's usually available to help you. He inspired my interest in programming and got me excited to be a CS major.",
      "Professor Pattis is one of the best teachers to get as an ICS student here in Irvine. He makes you work smart, not hard. You gain a very good understanding of the topic if you attend the lectures, and you can definitely do well because of him. He challenges you. That is why people sometimes find it difficult, but then again, it is computer science.",
      "His lectures are too long... The midterm and final are too hard, but the programming exams are good. If you can't decide whether you want to take this class of not - take it. Didn't go to the lectures - got an A.",
      "Pattis is the kind of teacher who would be excellent for upper-div courses. He posts HELLA notes which you have to be nocturnal to be able to read them all. Labs are fair, but challenging. Take-home quizzes the same. Programming exams were a good grade booster for me. Midterm and final are hard so study, but you can definitely pass this class.",
      "Wonderful professer who does a lot of neat lectures with important material that needs to be covered. His tests and quizzes are puzzling and challenging, making them slightly difficult, but with the inclusion of programming assignments the class is well-balanced and is one which is surely a good choice for anyone needing to take ICS 23.",
      "If you need to take ICS 23 at UCI take it with Pattis! A very difficult class for people relatively new to programming. His grading sometimes can seem unfair, since people who can program get an A+. Still Pattis is a kind teacher who cares a lot and one of the best in ICS at UCI",
      "Awesome teacher, MUCH better than the rest of the CS professors at UCI. Has a website that actually has a search function for his class site, which helps immensely. Has copious amounts of office hours, tests are not as bad as other CS professors. Also has a &quot;normalization&quot; curve in case average scores on tests dip below 70%.",
      "Good teacher who definitely knows what he is talking about. Class was challenging, but also fun at times. The final was incredibly difficult (average was a 115/200). If you keep on top of things from the beginning until the end it should be a fun class. DO NOT FALL BEHIND. If you do, you're in trouble.",
      "He is a really nice guy and very helpful. Lectures were long, but the notes are online if you zone out.",
      "Very chill teacher. Easily understandable and easy grader. Lecture notes are online and as long as you read all of them you'll be good. Quizzes are hard but programs and tests are fairly easy. Definitely recommend him to anyone. And this is coming from someone who has never programmed.",
      "Difficult to keep up sometimes for new programmers, but he clearly lays out projects and is very accessible. Tests aren't too tough and he uses a very easy grading scale. Lectures can be a little dry as always with programming classes",
      "I really like Pattis. He's extremely dedicated and cares about his students. Everything you need to know is written out in wonderful online notes he uses for lectures. If you pay attention in lecture, you don't really need to read or take notes.",
      "Great teacher. Tries to give you the highest possible grade possible and is concerned about the success of your future. Highly recommended.",
      "This course was easy, professor teaches well. Read the lecture notes and do the problems he assigns and you'll be well-prepared for anything.",
      "Highly dedicated teacher. Notes online, though much more beneficial to attend lectures. Attends labs to help students debug. Midterm/final mentally exhausting, but highly reflects the quizzes, which aren't hard if you pay attn in class. A self-pronounced geek, which is a good thing when you're taking compsci!",
        "Great school, I love UCI.",
        "This is a very good university, navigating it is easy and fast.",
        "It's an absolute pleasure to be a part of a campus experiencing a meteoric rise. Invest in UCI stock.",
        "I was an exchange studet at UCI more than 5 years ago. It had great courses and educational opportunities but was a little boring in terms of social environment, especially for international students. While it was rather easy to get to know other international students, I needed to make some efforts to reach out to the local students' community.",
        "The more effort you put into the school the better experience you are going to get. The social scene is dead if you expect it to come to you. You have to find the people you want to be around via clubs or finding people. Classes and professors might be hit or miss but guaranteed you will find one class or professor that you will enjoy.",
        "Its great",
        "Its good in general.",
        "Social science majors are generally good. This school does good overall. It gives you opportunities but you also have to look for them. Socially its dismal, but it depends on your background there is a chance that you can be very happy socially.",
        "Beautiful campus with a flowing circular design. Great professors, strong Computer Science department. Major companies recruit at career fairs (Google, Amazon, Facebook). Irvine is a great location for tech and altogether a beautiful city.",
        "Its the best place to learn unlike other grad schools they focus more on education it may look conservative campus but we are here to study n we got to do that right",
        "The safest place you can get, period",
        "This campus is great, if you are a transfer, rest assured you've been through the worst. Classes and professors are chill, some harder than others, but overall a great experience. almost no outside life if you don't plan for it, gotta work extra to get social. Food almost all around, and good walks, weather is also great! 8/10",
        "UCI is a great school for serious workers &amp; those in STEM fields. There's not really a social scene for you here unless you get involved with Greek Life or you play video games like all the nerds here lol. I feel like many students (particularly the Asians) feel a pressure to succeed &amp; get good grades. I've never been a minority til I came to UCI.",
        "ICS classes tend to require partner assignments and partners tend to be flakes. Soc Sci 10ABC series sucks- badly designed classes with terrible instructors. University is inflexible about math requirement (for all majors) take this into consideration. Social life only extends to Asian dance crews.",
        "The school is not that kind of big fancy school, but the environment around the school is incredible.",
        "Parking sucks. Most of lectures are useless. My worst decision attending to this damn school.",
        "Parking sucks. Most of lectures are useless. Should have gone to somewhere else! I made a worst decision by attending to this school.",
        "I love it",
        "Terrible choice attending this school",
        "I transferred from community college to UCI in the Fall for computer science. The school is very friendly and there's lots of social involvement with clubs, etc if you put yourself out there. The campus feels welcoming and there is a lot to do if you're willing to drive a bit. Lots of great restaurants nearby, especially if you're into Asian food.",
        "I think initially, coming to this school, I expected it to live up to some of the ratings on the site. But I have been here 2 years, transferred. My experience has been wonderful. I joined a dance team on campus meant for beginners, and coupled with awesome people, the dance , gaming and academic communities are fantastic! Live @ UTC or w/ friends!",
        "Satisfied",
        "Beautiful Campus",
        "yes",
        "I absolutely love this school. So easy to get around and to get involved.",
        "Irvine is a great place but you have to join the clubs to get the full experience of a college life. Otherwise, the social aspect is pretty meh and its very boring on the weekends. The food on campus is okay but we have a university village right next to campus with a lot of good food choices. The clubs also sell food. Try boba while you're here!!",
        "Really good school with opportunities everywhere. Get involved, plan things out, have a positive attitude and you'll love it but you have to get involved. Parking is expensive. Over-acceptance impacted classes, parking, study place--everything, it felt crowded this year but things will probably ease up next year. They're making new halls &amp; apts.",
        "So glad I chose to go here. Excellent decision socially, academically and environmentally.",
        "UCI is a great place to learn and it is taken very serious but socially it is pretty dead. There isn't much to do at school it is mostly frats and sororities that do things but some of them are pretty weird. There isn't much to do if you don't have a car :/ the school social life is pretty boring.",
        "I love it so far!!! ZOT ZOT ZOT!",
        "Love UCI!",
        "Good campus, everyone sleeps on it! Do not mind going to this school whatsoever, 10/10 choice. If you go there and don't wind up in Middle Earth you won't regret it.",
        "Its a beautiful campus, a lot of diversity (Minority is the majority), SAFE, expensive af though, respectable reputation, not a party school.",
        "Getting batter year by year! and harder to get into",
        "Just transferred in, but it's a great school in these aspects. However, I'm concerned about where our tuition money is actually going and why it keeps rising.",
        "Beautiful campus, beautiful weather, nice people. Professors are tough and classes are hard but hey, that's college.",
        "Really good campus, has a good vibe. Could use a better distribution of food locations (needs more food closer to engineering and RH). Bikes and longboards are banned on the main road around campus during the day so walking is a thing. Research opportunities are plentiful (even for undergrads) and the professors are overall pretty good (CompSci)",
        "Professors here are either hit or miss. Parking is a torture. Everything else is fine.",
        "I stayed in the new dorms in Mesa Ct - they weren't finished yet. Surprisingly, having 3 roommates wasn't an issue. The food was okay. I commute now and I like it much better. I chose to apply to UCI over UCLA bc the campus layout and location was SOOO much better.",
        "First quarter here at UCI and I loved it! The campus itself is so beautiful and everyone on campus is amazing too! Haven't had one bad professor and I only look forward to my future endeavours here at UCI. Get involved from the start if you're not too busy, cause that's what I regret not doing. Overall though, UCI was my best decision. ZOT ZOT ZOT!",
        "Love love love this school. Network heaven. ALL of the professors are extremely cerebral. Land of opportunities. If you can't make it here, you can't make it anywhere. The world is your oyster at UCI. Stay disciplined about your studies, treat your teachers well, and your road to success is paved with gold. Oh the librarians and UROP are AWESOME.",
        "Beautiful location (near beaches and parks), progressive faculty, clean green campus, and lots of eateries on campus or across the street.",
        "School is awesome, classes are very in-depth, the food eating areas are great. However, high enrollment levels (at least in my graduating class), buildings are not too interesting looking, and prices are expensive nearby. Check out the subreddit for some quality memes though.",
        "The campus itself is extremely beautiful there is always somewhere quiet that you can study.",
        "UCI has the best study spaces.",
        "Pretty good campus",
        "The UCI campus is beyond beautiful. The school offers many chances to be involved in research or clubs. This school is not very diverse and lacks in that category but the students are well rounded and great people. I am proud to call myself an anteater",
        "Fun campus, everyone here is very nice and welcoming. Good housing and respected professors.",
        "UC Irvine is a solid school with a solid campus. Everything here is solid. There are social events, but there seems to be less compared to other schools. I personally really like the food.",
        "it is good......",
        "uci has its ups, clubs and people are great, feels like people care about you and you're safe, but it shares all the same downs as all the other uc schools, researchers as teachers who cant lecture to save their lives, they basically have their grad students do all the real work and that can be good or bad, and overly impacted classes.",
        "Great school and stuff",
        "UCI was not my top choice, but I fell in love with the school once I took a tour. Definitely, it is a good school with an accessible location. The environment of the campus is pretty awesome!",
        "very nice shool",
        "Good school for Engineering/CS",
        "good one",
        "You will feel isolated by all of the international students.",
        "I had the best time of my life here. I love going back to visit. It's a beautiful campus with laid back faculty. You get out what you get out what you put in though. The research opportunities are second to none. That opened up countless opportunities for me. And don't forget to take the humanities core track. It really opened my mind.",
        "Throughout my high school experience, learning and going to class always felt like a chore. UCI has changed my outlook on school. I now NEED to get to class and learn or I'll feel bad. This school is very friendly, light hearted, and inviting. Students and faculty members all care about you and your success. I am very happy to be attending UCI.",
        "I love it here, everything about it is great",
        "Could use a lot of help socially, other than that its a great place to be.",
        "Overall it is a good school, really safe and with lots of club. Good education. Professors are better researchers than teachers. Opportunities depend on the department you are part of. University is well respected. Best way to get the most out of it is to join a research group/club as soon as you can and focus on that. Overall It's a good school.",
        "UC Irvine is located in a very strategic area of Southern California. Traffic jams are uncommon in Irvine. The roads are wide and there exist a bunch of luxurious apartments around here.",
        "Very glad I'm at UC Irvine! Profs are excellent (I'm Bio/English major), campus is peaceful and beautiful. Libraries are big and quiet. Many campus clubs and some trips to local Arts Ctr for free performances. I volunteer at UCIMC and use free shuttle service. When I need break, I go to beaches (lots of them nearby) or across street for food.",
        "UCI's a great school and the Anteatery (Mesa Court Dining Commons) is underrated",
        "Love the professors and TA's, but people here are a bit scary to approach (speaking with the opinion of a transfer student). Safe school, good food, but nothing to do and everything closes at 9 for the general part. Take advantage of all the free stuff!",
        "UCI is extremely underrated compared to the other UCs. Its a 10 min drive from the beach, great food, hundreds of clubs to join, and super safe. Academics are great, the social aspect always gets a low rating but its honestly what you make of it, it really isn't hard to find a party, usually at least a few going on every week.",
        "The department here is very very irresponsible! If something wrong happened to you, no matter if you are innocent or what, they just tell you go to ask another department and send you a psychologist.",
        "UC Irvine is a hidden gem within the UC's. Just miles from Newport Beach and in the heard of Orange County, UCI is the home to elite academic programs with an ever-growing environment and opportunities. While many people do not know UCI and it lacks the typical college social and athletic scene, there are opportunities to make the most of your time",
        "Only negatives is the social life here!",
        "Decent School",
        "Good campus",
        "Academics are at the center so frat/sorority live is more low-key, but that is good! food is amazing around campus and the location is safe, in great condition, and theres so much to do!",
        "it's legit",
        "As far as the undergraduate business program is concerned, UCI is only behind UCB in the state. Provides lots of job opportunities in Southern California, but not so great with people looking for jobs out of state. Not a good place for people looking to get into high profile careers like management consulting or investment banking.",
        "I LOVE IT!!!!!!!",
        "A beautiful campus with lots of professors that really care about their students and want to help them achieve their goals!",
        "UC Irvine is a really great campus filled with diversity (despite it being commonly known as University of Chinese Immigrants, just jokes!). Coming here was the best choice I have ever made and it will go down as one of the best environments I will ever be in. Love the atmosphere and professors, those who are coming here; you won't regret it.",
        "Very calm environment. Lots of walking. UTC is fun sometimes. Beautiful campus! New Mesa Court Towers are very nice! I love them! Got into UCLA, but committed to UCI because I LOVE UCI and its not as competitive and you dont have that pressure that you have to be a doctor because youre at ucla. LUV UCI!",
        "new dining hall and dorms are perfect",
        "UCI is da bomb",
        "I luv UCI",
        "UC Irvine is an incredible school. It is underrated by most people because it doesn't have the same name recognition that UCLA or Berkeley have, but the education is the same, if not better. I have never lacked for opportunities and feel like the education I am getting is worth what I am paying for.",
        "UCI is an overall great school, it has its good and bad professors as all colleges do. Despite that, the campus is really nice. So far I have not met any person who has been rude or mean to me personally, but there are some out there. There are a wide variety of clubs and if you want to be social it is highly advised that you put yourself out there",
        "I love UC Irvine! It was definitely the best choice for me! The campus is amazing and everyone here is so friendly! Best by far!",
        "Life at UC Irvine is definitely what you make of it. The social aspect is very alive (you can catch some lit parties every weekend), you always feel safe around here, the weather is mostly perfect, the whole environment just is happy. Make it the best!",
        "This university is truly a blessing. The facilities and staff members are top quality. There are many opportunities to get plugged in and involved with clubs. And you definitely can't go wrong with a walk in beautiful Aldrich Park on your way to class.",
        "Very nice overall, and Im only a freshman",
        "UCI is a mid tier UC. So, its comparatively one of the better universities in California. Unaware of reputation outside California. Definitely better than most CSUs but nowhere close to UC Berkeley. Irvine is considered to be one of the safest cities in the country. Alumni network is not too strong. Also, experience will differ according to major",
        "Great campus but one can get easily lost in the huge school both emotionally and physically. It is up to the student to go out of their way to make friends, go to club meetings and be social. This school does not baby you. You have to do your work and the teachers are generally very tough but good at teaching. VERY fast-paced. Do not underestimate.",
        "UCI is a fantastic place to be! A well rounded school and everyone here is so kind. The faculty and administration is also very helpful and welcoming.",
        "Academics are great, and I feel that the professors really do take their time to help out. Socially: UCI kids are, for the most part, more closed off and cliquey. This isn't always bad - if you're able to find your niche, you're honestly set. However, the social scene doesn't cater to everyone, so be aware! Overall, decent but not amazing school",
        "Zot, zot, ZOT!",
        "I love UCI. Here we have the best education, food, entertainment, etc.",
        "It's a University where you have to push yourself and be great! All of the professors in the humanities and bio Sci help you understand your potential, but they make you work and realize that you can one day help change the world. With all that said, no one really helps you with the transition to the real world. It's hard to get a job.",
        "Students are not friendly at all. They are full of themselves. The workload of reading is doable for rich students who get paid from their parents. It's not possible for a poor student who needs to work full-time study at UCI. Professors are tough and not understanding. I was much happier at other school but not UCI.",
        "It's better than it's reputation will say, but it is still not quite top notch. The education system is probably just as good as the other top UC's with great professors, classes, and academic assistance. There is just enough of a social scene to be happy if you are into that stuff too. Make sure to have a lot of units to get the classes u want.",
        "UC Irvine is a cool school with a lot of opportunity, but there are a lot of really boring students. It's difficult to connect with people unless you are very involved on campus. On campus housing sucks especially since there are so many families living in Irvine all around campus.",
        "In my opinion, UCI was a great school. The only thing I regret is not enjoying my college expereience to the fullest. I highly encourage anyone to be very involved socially since there are many social opportunities at the school. The only downside was the food. The food offered is not very good so I would recommend bringing your own lunch.",
        "Very small campus compared to other schools (less walking ;). Clubs for almost any interest out there, easy to get involved and find connections! Not too many hangout places right next to campus, but a lot within a 10 minute drive!",
        "Great campus. Many opportunities. Competitive in classroom.",
        "Great University. Glad I came here !!!",
        "For social, you just have to find the right people and find your place and you will be perfectly fine. I am a first year and have successfully and have found my place very fast. I am glad to call this my home. It is a UC though, it is challenging.",
        "UCI is kind of under the radar with its reputation but all of the students that go to UCI know how special it is. I honestly can't imagine another campus being the same way that UCI is -how welcoming the community feels and every involvement that it offers. UCI is a great place for academic excellence as well as personal learning experiences!",
        "So glad I came to UCI!",
        "I came for the Criminology program because it's the best in the state, so that's a major plus. The freshman dining halls are on the low end, but everything else is good. The area is a good college location esp. LA being close by. Make friends and join stuff and you'll have a great time! Wish the frat/sorority houses were nicer though, I wanna join",
        "Wouldn't choose another school over UCI.",
        "This school is hands down the best! It's rapidly rising in the ranks and will, without doubt, make it to the UCLA/CAL level in the mere future. Its already in the top 10 public universities in the nation!! Its very beautiful and has everything to offer. The people are all very friendly and you just always have a good time.",
        "UCI is definitely the school for me.",
        "This is the place to be",
        "I absolutely love UCI. Got accepted to others and decided here after talking to other students -- the faculty is amazing and the location is just five minutes away from the beach. There's tons of nightlife around the Costa Mesa and Newport areas if you know where to go. I couldn't ask for a better college experience, choose UCI!!!!",
        "I was accepted at UCLA, but I'm super glad I came to UCI. My professors have been great and the campus is BEAUTIFUL with lots of trees, close to the beach. More food places have popped up and I can walk to many of them. Parking can be a crunch if I'm running late. I made some good friends here and all of us are glad we came to UCI. AAA+++",
        "UC Irvine has given me the opportunity to learn a lot of things and I am thankful to be in such a nice and prestigious university. I have always liked UC Irvine, and I am proud to be an Anteater! UC Irvine has a lot of nice choices and there are not many problems around. I will miss this school and all the friendly people I met when I graduate.",
        "Good school but not too much going on.",
        "Located in Irvine, where there is not a lot of people, especially foreign people, know about it. The surrounding is very serene and calm. But the cost of living here is expensive, but I like it here a lot.",
        "I've made the devision to come to UCI. I chose it over UCSD.",
        "Great dorm life. Good people. Nice campus with many fresh opportunities to become something great. UCI faculty and staff are genuine and WANT to make you succeed. Just make sure you put the effort in it, to win it. The campus has a huge park to not take for granted. It's also near many beaches, hangouts, themeparks, and places to get your grub on.",
        "Nice",
        "This school should have much more hype than it actually does. The campus is gorgeous and in a really really nice area. We're a short drive away from newport beach and there's a party every night if you know the right people. There's a lot of clubs and orgs and the school really cares about their undergrads and there's a lot of opportunities.",
        "Amazing school. Only thing that lacks is the social life, but if you're choosing your education based on the social life you don't deserve one anyways lol",
        "The school is great. Great campus, great atmosphere and great people. The campus is very accepting and very progressive. It's also a very nice location, close to the beach and a stone throw from Disney and multiple malls. There are several clubs offering to satisfy many interests. The only issue is housing is a bit far, but the bus makes up for it.",
        "The engineering department has a lot to work on. I'd look into a more established engineering school before considering UCI. They have a lot of profs that are new to the material and hardly prep to teach. Not really a learning environment, more of a research facility with overpaid test proctors. Go to a CSU where they actually teach.",
        "UCI works hard to make this campus feel like a home away from home. The internet was iffy in the beginning of this year in Mesa Court, but it's all fixed now. The dining commons also might not be the best, but the environment and people at UCI surely make up for it. So happy to be part of the anteater family. ZOT ZOT ZOT!",
        "Nice location",
        "Very good environment with a lot of opportunities.",
        "cool place to be",
        "It is amazing. come and be an anteater",
        "-",
        "I couldn't be happier. Chose it over Davis, San Diego, and waitlist at UCLA. I have no regrets.",
        "UCI is a very distinguished campus that has a lot to offer. There are a lot of clubs and you will find your place. The campus is really nice and Aldrich Park is very peaceful. Dorm food is not the best, but it will get you through. Overall, a very good university.",
        "While I was going through the lists that this website provided me to rate, I acknowledged more that it really is the best school! We have a good reputation, especially starting this year, suburban local areas are so nice bunch of good restaurants nearby, and killing library! My happiness at UCI is beyond 100%!",
        "I'm currently a sophomore at UCI. I really do love the atmosphere here, mainly because I'm introverted and only have a few close friends who I hit up sometimes. The dining hall food does suck, but there's a lot of good food in Irvine if you have a car. If you're laid back, chill, and don't really care for parties, UCI's your place.",
        "Much better than what you expect from it's ranking.",
        "UCI's awesome. It is near many wonderful restaurants, the campus is fresh and welcoming and safe. If you live in campus and need a place to study, the libraries and the gateway study center are open, but sometimes, they get crowded and there are barely empty seats. I like Irvine and I love UCI.",
        "Amazing campus, makes you feel right at home. If you get homesick you can also go to Disneyland since its right around the corner, I heard it's the happiest place on Earth! Overall, I loved it!",
        "I majored in film&media studies and I absolutely love this school!! UCI provides me great opportunity and broad my horizon. It will help me get into this field in the future.",
        "Great school!",
        "People are very friendly and instructors are kind and helpful. Education is great! There are plenty of opportunities for research and internships. The social scene is not really that prominent especially since it is in a suburban area, but you can always find a way to have fun.",
        "UCI is a great school with an awesome campus. My advice- get involved in a club or some organization, and bring your car. Otherwise, life will be boring. But if you know where to look, UCI has a great social life and leadership opportunities. Plus, we're right next door to sunny Newport and Disneyland. (But also, parking is a pain).",
        "Great campus, lots of friendly people, amazing education, lots of opportunities to do awesome things! I love UCI, Zot Zot Zot!",
        "This campus is beautiful! Great faculty! On my way to grad school to get my PhD! Thank you UC Irvine!",
        "VERY happy I attended UC Irvine!",
        "UCI has a reputation for not being a social school, but there are plenty of people here who are friendly, sociable, and down to party.",
        "Ruled by tons of International Students!!!! I like the campus because Is not huge, it's clean green campus and easy to get around. Hate the parking and driving all together in Irvine.",
        "But I dont Wanna",
        "Very boring atmosphere, people look grumpy and just sad sometimes. Wish I visited the school before choosing to come here.",
        "The best",
        "It's a nice, clean campus that's easy to get around in since the foundation is based off the central park. Located in a safe, large city but a problem is many places are driving distances away from UCI",
        "perfect location, education and value.",
        "Best ever",
        "BEST IN THE WORLD",
        "Most underrated university ever. I love UCI and this place has shaped my life. Beatific campus, world renowned academics, seller reputation, many opportunities, chill people, great environment, what more can you ask for?",
        "best campus , food, and location",
        "I love UCI! Everyone is friendly and willing to help you out!",
        "best campus ever",
        "An amazing school that's given me a lot of opportunities to get out there. This school has a really good balance of academic and social life. No one's pressuring you to party all the time but if you wanna party, you can. Most of the students are welcoming and trustworthy. Having a car is almost a necessity though! And parking is WAY TOO EXPENSIVE.",
        "The Best!!!",
        "Love this school! ZotZotZot!",
        "I love UCI! We're still pretty up-and-coming but we're definitely a great school and there are so many amazing professors here who are really willing to help students out. Parking is terrible, though! Dining commons aren't the best but there's good food at UTC across the street.",
        "Loving it!",
        "A very amazing school. The atmosphere is very welcoming, it is very safe, and it is full of intelligent and caring students and staff. Proud to be a part of this university!",
        "UC Irvine is great, typical college, hard classes. If you're in a STEM major, expect competition, otherwise that its pretty laid back. Too chill probably for the people who like things happening all the time. If anything it may seem dead, but thats because everyone is out. Irvine pushes you to explore out side and make plans with people",
        "great school, i love it !",
        "Amazing school with an amazing reputation, and rightfully so. Socially speaking, if you are not a freshman the chances of you making friends is incredibly low (transfer students unite, seriously). In your nightmares you will hear \"$2 BOBBA!\" Be prepared to surround yourself with pompous people.",
        "UCIrvine was the only campus to offer my major of criminology. Loving it so far!",
        "Honestly, I think UCI is underrated. Sure, its full of a lot of kids who wished they could have gotten into UCLA (like me), but I seriously LOVE where I go to school. My only tip for future students, is if you want any sort of fun social life, join Greek life! I've made so many friends and don't know what I would do without my sorority!",
        "great school. the people are nice, the recreation center is awesome, professors(the ones that I've taken) are cool, and there are many things to do in your free time",
        "Awesome School!",
        "Lots of different clubs and organizations to join, abundant research opportunities, perfect weather, beautiful campus. Socially dead on the weekends, not a huge party school, but if you like to eat out, you'll have tons of fun. Get a job so you can have a car and pay for parking and gas money, and your four years will be a hell of a lot more fun.",
        "ZOT IS LIFE.",
        "Best decision I ever made! I love UCI 3",
        "I love it here!",
        "The campus is literally eye candy. Its so big and beautiful. I love how its centered around a park. You get to meet many need people and theres just so much in and near school! Go to UCI.",
        "Great Campus overall!! My initial thought was its a beautiful campus and great to just get my degree and graduate. Now, I want to be involved more and just wish there offered more digital art courses that I could take. Otherwise, awesome school.",
        "UC Irvine is underrated--even if Irvine itself is not a party city, Newport Beach is right next door, not to mention Disneyland, San Diego, Los Angeles, all a mild drive away.",
        "Great people!",
        "Irvine is not my first choice actually, but it is what I chose. I just fall in love with it! Nice campus and services, but expensive for international students.",
        "UCI is seriously like a hidden gem. Most of the world don't know how good students have it here because they're too caught up on world ratings that can be based off of anything. Weather is seriously superb here! Everyone here is always down to help each other out . It's FULL of opportunities but you have to seriously have to get involved!",
        "I don't believe UC Irvine receives as much reputation as it deserves. It really is the hidden gem of the UC system. I think a lot of people overlook the campus because it is not as distinguished as Cal or UCLA, but in all honesty; UCI provides a great college atmosphere and I am enjoying every minute of my undergraduate career. Zot Zot Zot!!",
        "I am glad I came to UCI. I made better choice.",
        "It is a great place to go.",
        "I honestly think that my choice to go to this school was one of the best decisions I ever made. There are a lot of opportunities to take hold of and chances to make a difference in a community. The location is really nice because there are a lot of places nearby and beautiful beaches that are all within a reasonable distance.",
        "The atmosphere here is really chill. Everyone is really smart, but everybody is nice to each other so there's not that crazy competitive nature you get at more prestigious schools. There are a lot of opportunities to get involved with everything from research to quidditch! Overall, I have really enjoyed my experience here and never want to leave",
        "Probably one of the best schools in the country. UC IRVINE has it all: the brains, talent, reputation, location, world renowned professors, top med school, mba school, law school. Definitely the place to get a solid education with a prestigious name.",
        "It might not seem like much, but UC Irvine is one of the best schools in the country. Please do not turn it down because it is one of the most underrated campuses in the UC system. I love this school. its been a blessing to have been chosen as a student here.",
        "it's an awesome university!",
        "No comment",
        "It's above mediocre",
        "Very boring campus. No cool spots near campus, best thing is that the beach is not far away. Epitome of suburbia.",
        "UCI has a great vibe, great education, cool people, and a very good location. The social life lacks a little, but can be made up for with the Greek life..",
        "I love UCI. For those who think UCI might be boring because of the area, you're wrong, it's what you make of it. If you're into parties and all of that, the greeks are pretty good with that. It is kinda had to get out of Irvine if you don't have a car but other than that, UCI is a great school, absolutely beautiful campus! I'm so glad i came here",
        "UCI has lots of opportunities you can explore. As a business major, I am able to join various business clubs and fraternities. Although the foods are ok, but the atmosphere of the campus is fabulous.",
        "everyone here is super nice and they genuinely want to get to know you more than that if ever lost just look left or right and someone is there to help you",
        "This campus is wonderful with numerous trees and hroups of grasses. Besides that, many clubs are welcome everyone yo join their's. As for my experience, there are decent to awesome professsors. However, the weather is not that good since it is extremely hot someday as in my home country, Thailand.",
        "It's great",
        "Hit or miss with the professors. Some are great and some are absolutely horrid. Food choices aren''t amazing but new stuff has been opening recently.",
        "If you love nature you'll love the campus. Always nice to walk around.",
        "It's safe, nice, but challenging.",
        "nice school",
        "It is a really nice place with its programs improving every year.",
        "great",
        "good!",
        "Fantastic chemistry program!",
        "Love UCI!!!",
        "Good school, great education, immaculate campus!",
        "Great school in almost every way; however, horrible counselors for the most part. Most of them are very negative. They seem that they do not care about students' future. All that they care about is saving their school money by kicking out students out of their school. Also, there are some really rude professors.",
        "Very nice and clean school. Social life doesn't really exist unless you are affiliated w/ clubs, groups, or Greek life. Very culturally diverse. Very focused atmosphere for people who actually are making moves to go somewhere after college.",
        "It's a nice campus.",
        "Everything about this school is great!",
        "UC Irvine was a wonderful surprise. I had never toured Irvine before coming and it is not only a beautiful campus, it is also a perfect environment for growth with so many opportunities for research and internships. It's also a great campus for the social butterfly. Greek life is amazing. I would encourage a freshman to join many clubs!",
        "Great campus",
        "I love uci honestly the only thing i can say is come to uci and see it for your self",
        "UCI is seriously a hidden gem! I could not have asked for a better college experience anywhere else. UCI has the perfect balance of everything you need to grow, academically and socially!",
        "I love UC Irvine. It is fairly new, but it is really making a name for itself. They really take care of you here. I wouldn't ask for a better school, this is home!",
        "UCI is a hidden Gem!",
        "I think students should know that UCI is a well qualified school!",
        "Great school, often overlooked. Everyone here loves it.",
        "Irvine is pretty, but completely devoid of anything interesting. If you like chain stores, housing complexes and corporate buildings you'll love it here. UC Irvine probably has the worst social scene of any college ever. Period.",
        "Goood!",
        "EXCELLENT SCHOOL!",
        "It's the best school in California!",
        "I LOVE UCI",
        "If you live on campus life is much more fun then people make it out to be. work on campus it helps you make friends. get to know your roommates and it will become a party time soon ... just don't forget to study and do your work before you have fun. worth coming here. love it !!!! class of 2015",
        "great school for physics students, but not for econ students.If you want to take major as fiance, accounting, you d better change a school.",
        "I am fresh man this year, and this college is amazing for me. The students and stuffs are so nice and they helped me a lot.",

        "GREAT",
        "Good",
        "Great school",

        "Loved it",
        "I like UC Irvine very much! UCI is a pretty good school for students to study and live.",
        "This is my dream school. The teachers are difficult but you will get the hang of things. The biggest down fall is the price. Parking is $300 a quarter, even if you have a permit you can still get tickets. Apartments are high priced as well. I would not want to go anywhere else though.",
        "I would say it is the third best UC behind UCLA and Berkeley.",
        "Great school. Has great teachers. Really love the campus and the research opportunities offered.",
        "Challenging academic environment. Many students are pre-med or pre-law, and competition is high.",
        "I have been staying here for two years, everything seems great to me.",
        "Very calm and welcoming environment. This campus does not get the recognition that it deserves! Beautiful libraries. The park is an amazing place to hang out have picnics or games with friends or just sit and study.",
        "best",
        "I didn't know anything about UCI before joining but I have to say it is a nice school. Life is what you make it. Join clubs, don't blame the school for your own laziness ;) also, sometimes its frustrating that you can't get anywhere without a car but all in all, the engineering department is pretty bomb, everything is very clean and pretty too.",
        "Great school, some people consider it boring but it's because they don't look for fun. Newport beach is near and greek life is great.",
        "UCI is located in one of the safest cities in California. It is a very good study environment.",
        "i love uci",
        "This is the third university I have attended in the last 10 years I have been in and out of college. I can say that this is by far the best one that I have attended. They actually care about undergraduate students, and are highly supportive of undergraduates doing research, which is usually the domain of graduate students. Highly recommended.",
        "Beautiful campus! Enjoying it here.",
        "None.",
        "AMAZING school. The campus is gorgeous and not all spread out over the city, so it makes getting around pretty easy. The classes are very good and the professors are fantastic. You WILL get a quality education at this school.",
        "AMAZING SCHOOL! Sometimes it's underestimated, but the experience here so far is amazing! The beach is 10 minutes away!",
        "Irvine is such a great campus. I was accepted into others schools, yes including UCLA, but none compare to the atmosphere of the school and the lifestyle of Irvine residents.",
        "They're welcoming, fun, and make this a better campus.",
        "Learn how to use the library early on, it is your best friend when it comes to research and papers. Don't be intimidated by the Inter Library Loan System, feel free to use it and get any book from any campus. Just make sure to order it a week or two in advance. O",
          "Some say UCI is &quot;boring.&quot; Those are the people too lazy to go and look for something to do. Most parties take the form of kickbacks, which take place anywhere from local apartments to on campus, in the dorms (specifically Mesa Court). The only people who think UCI is boring are the freshmen living in the other dorm, Middle Earth.",
        "None.",
        "Humanities lacks intellectual rigour and opportunities;for this reason the quality of education is mediocre.Few classes are offered .It is almost impossible to double major because most classes are offered once a year.AT UCLA one could easily finish a major in one year.While here it takes approximately three years for one major.how Worthless.", "The campus is gorgeous and in a safe area. The student body is diverse, which provides a great opportunity to learn about other cultures. At first, it wasn't my intention to go to UC Irvine, but now I am incredibly happy to be here.",
        "None.",
        "It can be boring sometimes, but it's awesome!", "Computer Science & Engineering major. UCI is a top tier UC along with UCLA and UCB thanks to a private donation, prestige is almost Ivy and quality of classes is excellent. Lots of opportunities to get an interesting high-paying job and internships, awesome location, if you know the right people you can party every weekend in the beach too :P!",
        "None.",
        "You need a car to go into town or anywhere fun really. It's just the people and the government (student and chancellors) that make this school bad. We just need a good association, instead of UCLA rejects. I'm sure we're going to be one of the best UCs but we need time. We do have one fo the most beautiful campuses.",
        "None.",
        "Most of the students here are Asian. Very little diversity .very few things to do. The websites are horrible and take a while to learn to navigate. Very little student support. Apathetic about any issues I.e.tuition increase etc. Crowded and uncomfortable classes",
        "It is in the perfect setting, close to Irvine spectrum, the district, newport beach... There is so much to do!",
        "When I first started at UCI, it was a great school with an impeccable reputation. While I do not think the reputation has gone down much, the quality of the school has. The economy hit UCI hard and so many classes, school services, and even financial aid has been cut. The school spends more money on construction than the students.",
        "UCI is not UCLA or UC Berkeley as it should as a public university that offers an equal comparable education.Instruction is not 'world-class academics'.Professors may be'truly quality professors',but most are apathetic.Not worth the high tuition and the four years.'See for yourself'.How could you dedicate yourself when UCI does not dedicate itself&#63;",
        "UC Irvine is the rare combination of world-class academics, awesome atmosphere, good sports, and truly quality professors (compare Irvine to other schools & see for yourself!). If you are willing to dedicate yourself to your education and to the campus itself, you'll find that UCI will dedicate itself in supporting you as well. Rip 'em Eaters!!!",
        "Not a school for humanities!You will find out as this school offers a dearth of courses, instruction is mediocre,workload is insufficient.Do not attend as the debt crisis will degrade of your education.Look at UCLA and UC Berkely schedule and compare.These students will do better than you in employment,so transfer or have an inferiority complex",
        "Classes here do not resemble university courses,and professors do not even attempt to teach at this level because they believe that you are inferior.If this is a public school, it should not offer a mediocre education, but this school rather demeans you. Especially the English department intends to be novel about its idiotic class titles. A waste o",
        "A lot of people say that UCI is a commuter campus and that it is dead past 5PM. However, it is up to YOU to find out what's going on on campus. Get involved, meet new people, step out of your comfort zone. Being at UCI has allowed me to grow as a person outside of academics. It has a lot to offer and all you have to do is take advantage it!",
        "I love UCI. I wouldn't trade my experience here for anything.",
        "Not Specified.",
        "Coming from a semester system to a quarter system kicked my butt. No time to actually learn and grow. Emphasis on memorization. Most professors are impersonal, not good lecturers, knowledgeable but not good at teaching.",
        "HIGHLY encourage you to go Greek, great social supplement to a highly driven academic environment",
        "Do not attend if you are a humanities major because the quality of courses and instruction will not equate the value of your major, compare to other socal institutions,when it comes to employment.This shows in the reading lists and content of courses,conveying professors'condenscending presupposition of your inferior intelligence, reasoning, etc.",
        "If you are a humanities major and socal resident, and didn't get accepted to UCLA or USC, be a realist and attend two humiliating years at community college and transfer; otherwise, you will be derised as employers prefer UCLA or USC. As an English major at UCI, I await humiliation and unemployment. Ivy league profs treat you odiously.",
        "As an English major, I am dissapointed. English courses are insignificant and inferior compared to other schools. Attending UC Irvine has been the worst and most miserable three years of my life. I am ashame, I do not think that the english major will be valuable and profitable.",
        "Work your butt off and you'll get a good job. Remember that.",
        "I love UCI!",
        "Get involved in a campus organization! There's so much more than attending lectures and discussions. UCI provides so many opportunities to get involved outside of the classroom. I think people overreact when they say it's a dead campus after 5PM. You have to make the most out of your college career so take advantage of everything it has to offer.",
        "Not Specified.",
        "It is a great school with a BEAUTIFUL campus. Most of the teachers are wonderful, just be sure to check on ratemyprofessor before signing-up for classes.",
        "Lots of large lecture courses, and these aren't conducive to getting acquainted with UCI professors, many of whom are amazing. Get to know them & your TAs outside of class. Interacting with professors & TAs will help you with your class work, help cultivate mentor-mentee relationships, and help you when you need letters of recommendation.",
        "This school blows. Go here if you're not accepted anywhere else. This is simply an extension of high school which becomes most prevalent by the elitist indoctrinating fraternal lifestyle that has plagued the campus. The weather is nice and there are a few cute girls in the arts department. They have a Wendy's. Parking is hell. Students are kids. D-",
        "Not a prestigious school, but good enough for your future. Professors and TAs are okay, although not the best. If you are just looking for a degree for employment, then UCI should be more than fine.",
        "I love UCI! The campus has grown tremendously over the past four years that I've been here. I'm proud to be an Anteater. Beautiful campus. Great location. Really nice people. Easy to get involved. Fun campus-wide events. I'm thankful for the experience. ZOT!",
        "I love this school! I'm glas I chose UCI over UCSD"
